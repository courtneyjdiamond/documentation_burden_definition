10.1370/afm.2121,28893811,,Tethered to the EHR: Primary Care Physician Workload Assessment Using EHR Event Log Data and Time-Motion Observations,"PURPOSE  Primary care physicians spend nearly 2 hours on electronic health record (EHR) tasks per hour of direct patient care. Demand for non–face-to-face care, such as communication through a patient portal and administrative tasks, is increasing and contributing to burnout. The goal of this study was to assess time allocated by primary care physicians within the EHR as indicated by EHR user-event log data, both during clinic hours (defined as 8:00 am to 6:00 pm Monday through Friday) and outside clinic hours.  METHODS  We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 142 family medicine physicians in a single system in southern Wisconsin. All Epic (Epic Systems Corporation) EHR interactions were captured from “event logging” records over a 3-year period for both direct patient care and non–face-to-face activities, and were validated by direct observation. EHR events were assigned to 1 of 15 EHR task categories and allocated to either during or after clinic hours.  RESULTS  Clinicians spent 355 minutes (5.9 hours) of an 11.4-hour workday in the EHR per weekday per 1.0 clinical full-time equivalent: 269 minutes (4.5 hours) during clinic hours and 86 minutes (1.4 hours) after clinic hours. Clerical and administrative tasks including documentation, order entry, billing and coding, and system security accounted for nearly one-half of the total EHR time (157 minutes, 44.2%). Inbox management accounted for another 85 minutes (23.7%).  CONCLUSIONS  Primary care physicians spend more than one-half of their workday, nearly 6 hours, interacting with the EHR during and after clinic hours. EHR event logs can identify areas of EHR-related work that could be delegated, thus reducing workload, improving professional satisfaction, and decreasing burnout. Direct time-motion observations validated EHR-event log data as a reliable source of information regarding clinician time allocation.","Brian Arndt,John W. Beasley,Michelle D. Watkinson,Jonathan L.

10.7326/m14-2128,25581028,,Clinical documentation in the 21st century: executive summary of a policy position paper from the American College of Physicians.,"Clinical documentation was developed to track a patient's condition and communicate the author's actions and thoughts to other members of the care team. Over time, other stakeholders have placed additional requirements on the clinical documentation process for purposes other than direct care of the patient. More recently, new information technologies, such as electronic health record (EHR) systems, have led to further changes in the clinical documentation process. Although computers and EHRs can facilitate and even improve clinical documentation, their use can also add complexities; new challenges; and, in the eyes of some, an increase in inappropriate or even fraudulent documentation. At the same time, many physicians and other health care professionals have argued that the quality of the systems being used for clinical documentation is inadequate. The Medical Informatics Committee of the American College of Physicians has undertaken this review of clinical documentation in an effort to clarify the broad range of complex and interrelated issues surrounding clinical documentation and to suggest a path forward such that care and clinical documentation in the 21st century best serve the needs of patients and families.","Thomson Kuhn,Peter Basch,Michael S.

10.1093/jamia/ocv066,26024883,,Report of the AMIA EHR-2020 Task Force on the status and future direction of EHRs,"Over the last 5 years, stimulated by the changing healthcare environment and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Meaningful Use (MU) Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive program, EHR adoption has increased remarkably, and there is early evidence that such adoption has resulted in healthcare safety and quality benefits.1,2 However, with this broad adoption, many clinicians are voicing concerns that EHR use has had unintended clinical consequences, including reduced time for patient-clinician interaction,3 new and burdensome data entry tasks being transferred to front-line clinicians,4,5 and lengthened clinician workdays.6–8 Additionally, interoperability between different EHR systems has languished despite large efforts towards that goal.9,10 These challenges are contributing to physicians’ decreased satisfaction with their work lives.11–13 In professional journals,14 press reports,15–17 on wards, and in clinics, we have heard of the difficulties that the transition from paper records to EHRs has created.18 As a result, clinicians are seeking help to get through their work days, which often extend into evenings devoted to writing notes. Examples of comments we have received from clinicians and patients include: “Computers always make things faster and cheaper. Not this time,” and “My doctor pays more attention to the computer than to me.”

Ultimately the healthcare system's goal is to create a robust, integrated, and interoperable healthcare system that includes patients, physician practices, public health, population management, and support for clinical and basic sciences research. This ecosystem has been referred to as the “learning health system.”19 EHRs are an important part of the learning health system, along with many other clinical systems, but future ways in which information is transformed into knowledge will likely require all parts of the system working together.

Objectives  This is a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate scribe effect on patient throughput, revenue, and patient and provider satisfaction.    Methods  Six electronic databases were systematically searched from inception until May 2015. We included studies where clinicians used a scribe. We collected throughput metrics, billing data, and patient/provider satisfaction data. Meta-analyses were conducted using a random effects model and mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with adherence to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement.    Results  From a total of 210 titles, 17 studies were eligible and included. Qualitative analysis suggests improvement in provider/patient satisfaction. Meta-analysis on throughput data was derived from 3 to 5 studies depending on the metric; meta-analysis revealed no impact of scribes on length of stay (346 minutes for scribes, 344 minutes for nonscribed; MD −1.6 minutes, 95% CI −22.3 to 19.2 minutes) or provider-to-disposition time (235 minutes for scribes, 216 for nonscribed; MD −18.8 minutes, 95% CI −22.3 to 19.2) with an increase in patients seen per hour (0.17 more patient per hour; 95% CI 0.02-32). Two studies reported relative value units, which increased 0.21 (95% CI 0-0.42) per patient with scribe use.    Conclusion  We found no difference in length of stay or time to disposition with a small increase in the number of patients per hour seen when using scribes. Potential benefits include revenue and patient/provider satisfaction.","Heather A. Heaton,Ana Castaneda-Guarderas,Elliott R. Trotter,Patricia J. Erwin,Patricia J. Erwin,Patricia J. Erwin,M.

10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2013.05.008,23770027,,Unintended adverse consequences of introducing electronic health records in residential aged care homes,"Abstract   Purpose  The aim of this study was to investigate the unintended adverse consequences of introducing electronic health records (EHR) in residential aged care homes (RACHs) and to examine the causes of these unintended adverse consequences.    Method  A qualitative interview study was conducted in nine RACHs belonging to three organisations in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland, Australia. A longitudinal investigation after the implementation of the aged care EHR systems was conducted at two data points: January 2009 to December 2009 and December 2010 to February 2011. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 110 care staff members identified through convenience sampling, representing all levels of care staff who worked in these facilities. Data analysis was guided by DeLone and McLean Information Systems Success Model, in reference with the previous studies of unintended consequences for the introduction of computerised provider order entry systems in hospitals.    Results  Eight categories of unintended adverse consequences emerged from 266 data items mentioned by the interviewees. In descending order of the number and percentage of staff mentioning them, they are: inability/difficulty in data entry and information retrieval, end user resistance to using the system, increased complexity of information management, end user concerns about access, increased documentation burden, the reduction of communication, lack of space to place enough computers in the work place and increasing difficulties in delivering care services. The unintended consequences were caused by the initial conditions, the nature of the EHR system and the way the system was implemented and used by nursing staff members.    Conclusions  Although the benefits of the EHR systems were obvious, as found by our previous study, introducing EHR systems in RACH can also cause adverse consequences of EHR avoidance, difficulty in access, increased complexity in information management, increased documentation burden, reduction of communication and the risks of lacking care follow-up, which may cause negative effects on aged care services. Further research can focus on investigating how the unintended adverse consequences can be mitigated or eliminated by understanding more about nursing staff's work as well as the information flow in RACH. This will help to improve the design, introduction and management of EHR systems in this setting.","Ping Yu,Yiting Zhang,Yang Gong,Jianjia Zhang",International Journal of Medical Informatics,2013
10.1007/s40746-019-00147-6,31632895,,Organizational factors affecting physician well-being.,"Symptoms of burnout affect approximately half of pediatricians and pediatric subspecialists at any given time, with similarly concerning prevalence of other aspects of physician distress, including fatigue, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation. Physician well-being affects quality of care, patient satisfaction, and physician turnover. Organizational factors influence well-being, stressing the need for organizations to address this epidemic. Organizational characteristics, policies, and culture influence physician well-being, and specific strategies may support an environment where physicians thrive. We highlight four organizational opportunities to improve physician well-being: developing leaders, cultivating community and organizational culture, improving practice efficiency, and optimizing administrative policies. Leaders play a key role in aligning organizational and individual values, promoting professional fulfillment, and fostering a culture of collegiality and social support among physicians. Reducing documentation burden and improving practice efficiency may help balance job demands and resources. Finally, reforming administrative policies may reduce work-home conflict, support physician’s efforts to attend to their own well-being, and normalize use of supportive resources. Physician well-being is critical to organizational success, sustainment of an adequate workforce, and optimal patient outcomes. Because burnout is primarily influenced by organizational factors, organizational interventions are key to promoting well-being. Developing supportive leadership, fostering a culture of wellness, optimizing practice efficiency, and improving administrative policies are worthy of organizational action and further research.","Daniel S.

10.1055/s-0037-1615747,29342479,,Time Spent on Dedicated Patient Care and Documentation Tasks Before and After the Introduction of a Structured and Standardized Electronic Health Record.,"BackgroundPhysicians spend around 35% of their time documenting patient data. They are concerned that adopting a structured and standardized electronic health record (EHR) will lead to more time documenting and less time for patient care, especially during consultations.     ObjectiveThis study measures the effect of the introduction of a structured and standardized EHR on documentation time and time for dedicated patient care during outpatient consultations.     MethodsWe measured physicians' time spent on four task categories during outpatient consultations: documentation, patient care, peer communication, and other activities. Physicians covered various specialties from two university hospitals that jointly implemented a structured and standardized EHR. Preimplementation, one hospital used a legacy-EHR, and one primarily paper-based records. The same physicians were observed 2 to 6 months before and 6 to 8 months after implementation.   We analyzed consultation duration, and percentage of time spent on each task category. Differences in time distribution before and after implementation were tested using multilevel linear regression.     ResultsWe observed 24 physicians (162 hours, 439 consultations). We found no significant difference in consultation duration or number of consultations per hour. In the legacy-EHR center, we found the implementation associated with a significant decrease in time spent on dedicated patient care (−8.5%). In contrast, in the previously paper-based center, we found a significant increase in dedicated time spent on documentation (8.3%) and decrease in time on combined patient care and documentation (−4.6%). The effect on dedicated documentation time significantly differed between centers.     ConclusionImplementation of a structured and standardized EHR was associated with 8.5% decrease in time for dedicated patient care during consultations in one center and 8.3% increase in dedicated documentation time in another center. These results are in line with physicians' concerns that the introduction of a structured and standardized EHR might lead to more documentation burden and less time for dedicated patient care.","Erik Joukes,Ameen Abu-Hanna,Ameen Abu-Hanna,A.

To support these changes, regulators and payers have temporarily modified long-standing policies, recognizing the need for a trade-off between the costs and benefits of oversight during times of crisis. Specifically, there has been a heightened receptivity to the importance of preserving physicians' and other health care professionals' time, cognitive bandwidth, and emotional reserve for the direct care of patients, instead of squandering these resources on low-value tasks and frustrating technology. Instead of reflexively reverting to past practices and policies, there is now an opportunity to take advantage of the lessons of COVID-19 for the further transformation of health care to achieve Quadruple Aim outcomes (better care for individuals, better health for the population, better experience for clinicians, and lower costs). We outline some of the policy and practice changes that we believe should endure after the crisis has passed, and we recommend using similar logic during noncrisis times to make additional changes to further reduce administrative burden, and thus improve patient care.","Christine A.

Motivations for this trend include patient safety, regulatory requirements, and healthcare cost containment. However, the impact of regulatory requirements and new EHRs on clinicians has increased the incidence of documentation burden and may lead to burnout syndrome. It is important to understand the extent of documentation burden and potential solutions such as EHR user-interface redesign and the use of scribes to assist healthcare providers across the world.","Emily Gesner,Emily Gesner,Priscilla K.

10.1136/amiajnl-2012-000894,22822042,,"Challenges to nurses' efforts of retrieving, documenting, and communicating patient care information.","Objective To examine information flow, a vital component of a patient's care and outcomes, in a sample of multiple hospital nursing units to uncover potential sources of error and opportunities for systematic improvement.

Design This was a qualitative study of a sample of eight medical—surgical nursing units from four diverse hospitals in one US state. We conducted direct work observations of nursing staff's communication patterns for entire shifts (8 or 12 h) for a total of 200 h and gathered related documentation artifacts for analyses. Data were coded using qualitative content analysis procedures and then synthesized and organized thematically to characterize current practices.

Results Three major themes emerged from the analyses, which represent serious vulnerabilities in the flow of patient care information during nurse hand-offs and to the entire interdisciplinary team across time and settings. The three themes are: (1) variation in nurse documentation and communication; (2) the absence of a centralized care overview in the patient's electronic health record, ie, easily accessible by the entire care team; and (3) rarity of interdisciplinary communication.

Conclusion The care information flow vulnerabilities are a catalyst for multiple types of serious and undetectable clinical errors. We have two major recommendations to address the gaps: (1) to standardize the format, content, and words used to document core information, such as the plan of care, and make this easily accessible to all team members; (2) to conduct extensive usability testing to ensure that tools in the electronic health record help the disconnected interdisciplinary team members to maintain a shared understanding of the patient's plan.","Gail M.

10.1093/jamia/ocaa325,33434273,,Measurement of clinical documentation burden among physicians and nurses using electronic health records: a scoping review.,"BACKGROUND OBJECTIVE Electronic health records (EHRs) are linked with documentation burden resulting in clinician burnout. While clear classifications and validated measures of burnout exist, documentation burden remains ill-defined and inconsistently measured. We aim to conduct a scoping review focused on identifying approaches to documentation burden measurement and their characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS Based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Extension for Scoping Reviews (ScR) guidelines, we conducted a scoping review assessing MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and CINAHL from inception to April 2020 for studies investigating documentation burden among physicians and nurses in ambulatory or inpatient settings. Two reviewers evaluated each potentially relevant study for inclusion/exclusion criteria. RESULTS Of the 3482 articles retrieved, 35 studies met inclusion criteria. We identified 15 measurement characteristics, including 7 effort constructs: EHR usage and workload, clinical documentation/review, EHR work after hours and remotely, administrative tasks, cognitively cumbersome work, fragmentation of workflow, and patient interaction. We uncovered 4 time constructs: average time, proportion of time, timeliness of completion, activity rate, and 11 units of analysis. Only 45.0% of studies assessed the impact of EHRs on clinicians and/or patients and 40.0% mentioned clinician burnout. DISCUSSION Standard and validated measures of documentation burden are lacking. While time and effort were the core concepts measured, there appears to be no consensus on the best approach nor degree of rigor to study documentation burden. CONCLUSION Further research is needed to reliably operationalize the concept of documentation burden, explore best practices for measurement, and standardize its use.","Amanda J. Moy,Jessica M.

10.1093/jamia/ocy155,30576561,,Clinicians' reasoning as reflected in electronic clinical note-entry and reading/retrieval: a systematic review and qualitative synthesis.,"Objective: To describe the literature exploring the use of electronic health record (EHR) systems to support creation and use of clinical documentation to guide future research. Materials and Methods: We searched databases including MEDLINE, Scopus, and CINAHL from inception to April 20, 2018, for studies applying qualitative or mixed-methods examining EHR use to support creation and use of clinical documentation. A qualitative synthesis of included studies was undertaken. Results: Twenty-three studies met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed in detail. We briefly reviewed 9 studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria but provided recommendations for EHR design. We identified 4 key themes: purposes of electronic clinical notes, clinicians' reasoning for note-entry and reading/retrieval, clinicians' strategies for note-entry, and clinicians' strategies for note-retrieval/reading. Five studies investigated note purposes and found that although patient care is the primary note purpose, non-clinical purposes have become more common. Clinicians' reasoning studies (n=3) explored clinicians' judgement about what to document and represented clinicians' thought process in cognitive pathways. Note-entry studies (n=6) revealed that what clinicians document is affected by EHR interfaces. Lastly, note-retrieval studies (n=12) found that ""assessment and plan"" is the most read note section and what clinicians read is affected by external stimuli, care/information goals, and what they know about the patient. Conclusion: Despite the widespread adoption of EHRs, their use to support note-entry and reading/retrieval is still understudied. Further research is needed to investigate approaches to capture and represent clinicians' reasoning and improve note-entry and retrieval/reading.","Tiago K. Colicchio,James J.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Literature published from January 1, 2007 to June 3, 2020 was systematically reviewed from multiple databases and hand searches. Subgroup analysis identified relevant physician burnout studies with interventions examining digital tool burden, related workflow inefficiencies, and measures of burnout, stress, or job satisfaction in all practice settings. RESULTS The search strategy identified 4806 citations of which 81 met inclusion criteria. Thirty-eight studies reported interventions to decrease digital tool burden. Sixty-eight percent of these studies reported improvement in burnout and/or its proxy measures. Burnout was decreased by interventions that optimized technologies (primarily electronic health records), provided training, reduced documentation and task time, expanded the care team, and leveraged quality improvement processes in workflows. DISCUSSION The contribution of digital tools to physician burnout can be mitigated by careful examination of usability, introducing technologies to save or optimize time, and applying quality improvement to workflows. CONCLUSION Physician burnout is not reduced by technology implementation but can be mitigated by technology and workflow optimization, training, team expansion, and careful consideration of factors affecting burnout, including specialty, practice setting, regulatory pressures, and how physicians spend their time.","Kelly J.

,30815074,,Quantifying and Visualizing Nursing Flowsheet Documentation Burden in Acute and Critical Care.,"Documentation burden is a well-documented problem within healthcare, and improvement requires understanding of the scope and depth of the problem across domains. In this study we quantified documentation burden within EHR flowsheets, which are primarily used by nurses to document assessments and interventions. We found mean rates of 633-689 manual flowsheet data entries per 12-hour shift in the ICU and 631-875 manual flowsheet data entries per 12-hour shift in acute care, excluding device data. Automated streaming of device data only accounted for 5-20% of flowsheet data entries across our sample. Reported rates averaged to a nurse documenting 1 data point every 0.82-1.14 minutes, despite only a minimum data-set of required documentation. Increased automated device integration and novel approaches to decrease data capture burden (e.g., voice recognition), may increase nurses’ available time for interpretation, annotation, and synthesis of patient data while also further advancing the richness of information within patient records.","Sarah A.

10.1093/jamia/ocaa339,33517382,,A systematic review of contributing factors of and solutions to electronic health record–related impacts on physician well-being,"OBJECTIVE Physicians often describe the electronic health record (EHR) as a cumbersome impediment to meaningful work, which has important implications for physician well-being. This systematic review (1) assesses organizational, physician, and information technology factors associated with EHR-related impacts on physician well-being; and (2) highlights potential improvements to EHR form and function, as recommended by frontline physicians. MATERIALS AND METHODS The MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ProQuest, and Web of Science databases were searched for literature describing EHR use by physicians and markers of well-being. RESULTS After reviewing 7388 article, 35 ultimately met the inclusion criteria. Multiple factors across all levels were associated with EHR-related well-being among physicians. Notable predictors amenable to interventions include (1) total EHR time, (2) after-hours EHR time, (3) on-site EHR support, (4) perceived EHR usability, (5) in-basket burden, and (6) documentation burden. Physician recommendations also echoed these themes. CONCLUSIONS There are multiple complex factors involved in EHR-related well-being among physicians. Our review shows physicians have recommendations that span from federal regulations to organizational policies to EHR modifications. Future research should assess multipronged interventions that address these factors. As primary stakeholders, physicians should be included in the planning and implementation of such modifications to ensure compatibility with physician needs and clinical workflows.","Oliver Nguyen,Nyasia J Jenkins,Neel Khanna,Shivani Shah,Alexander J Gartland,Kea Turner,Lisa J.

We seek to relate findings with research from other health contexts, to compare different stakeholders’ perspectives, expectations, actual experiences with PAEHRs, and identify potential research gaps. </sec> <sec> <title>METHODS</title> A systematic scoping review was carried out for six electronic databases. Studies were included focusing on digital sharing of clinical notes or EHRs with people affected by a mental health condition up to September 2021. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used to assess the quality of the studies. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyzes extension for Scoping Reviews guided the narrative synthesis and reporting of findings. </sec> <sec> <title>RESULTS</title> Of the 1.032 papers screened, 29 were included in this review. The studies used mostly qualitative methods or surveys and were predominantly published after 2018 in the US. PAEHRs were examined in outpatient (n=27) and inpatient settings (n=9), while a third of all research was conducted in Veterans Affairs Mental Health. There was no focus on specific psychiatric diagnoses among SUs. Narrative synthesis allowed to integrate findings according to the different stakeholders: (1) Service users reported mainly positive experiences with PAEHRs such as increased trust in their clinician, health literacy and empowerment. Negative experiences were related to inaccurate notes, disrespectful language used, or the uncovering of undiscussed diagnoses. (2) For health care professionals (HCPs), concerns outweighed the benefits of sharing EHRs, including an increased clinical burden due to more documentation efforts and possible harm triggered by reading the notes. (3) Relatives gained a better understanding of their family members' mental problems and were able to better support them when having access to their EHR. (4) Policy stakeholders and experts addressed ethical challenges and recommended the development of guidelines and trainings to better prepare both clinicians and SUs on how to write and read notes. </sec> <sec> <title>CONCLUSIONS</title> PAEHRs in MHC may strengthen user involvement, patients' autonomy and shift medical treatment to a co-produced process. Acceptance issues among HCPs align with findings from general health settings and may change over time. Notably, however, the corpus of evidence on digital sharing of EHRs with people affected by mental health conditions is limited. Above all, further research is needed to examine clinical effectiveness, efficiency and implementation of this socio-technical intervention. </sec>","Julian Schwarz,Annika Bärkås,Charlotte Blease,Lorna Collins,Maria Hägglund,Sarah Markham,Stefan Hochwarter",JMIR Mental Health,

10.1097/ta.0000000000000986,26886003,,The painful truth: The documentation burden of a trauma surgeon,"BACKGROUND: Implementation of the electronic medical record (EMR) has introduced several unintended consequences, including increased documentation demands. The purpose of this study was to define the EMR documentation burden and its economic impact at a busy regional Level I trauma center, comparing attending trauma surgeons (TSs) with orthopedic surgeons (OSs), and neurosurgeons (NSs). METHODS: The EMR was queried to determine the number of attending documentation entries during 2014 for TS, OS, and NS. The eight TSs were then surveyed to estimate the time it took to write each note type, and this was used to calculate the total time needed for documentation. The hospital financial database was queried for 2014 hospital charges and work relative value units (WRVUs) for TSs, OSs, and NSs to generate a comparison. The charges and WRVUs were broken down into those generated from nonprocedural documentation and procedures. RESULTS: During 2014, there were 5,864 trauma activations with 3,111 patient admissions. The attending TSs wrote a total of 26,455 documentation entries. Of these notes, 92% were from inpatients, and 74% were progress notes. Documentation time estimates for TSs demonstrated that it took 1,760.5 hours or 73.3 twenty-four-hour days to complete these 26,455 notes. Financial data revealed that 44% of the TS charges were directly related to nonprocedural documentation, compared with 14% for OSs and 7% for NSs. Evaluation of WRVUs demonstrated that 55% of the TS WRVUs were directly related to nonprocedural documentation, compared with 28% for OSs and 19% for NSs. CONCLUSION: The EMR has introduced a significant documentation burden to the busy TSs. This documentation burden is critical for defining hospital charges and WRVUs, and it differs from that of OSs and NSs. Workflow changes, such as the introduction of scribes, may lessen the documentation burden and improve hospital charges and WRVUs of the TSs.","Joseph F. Golob,John J. Como,Jeffrey A.
