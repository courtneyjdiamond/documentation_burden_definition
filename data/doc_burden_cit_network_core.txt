Notes: Jennifer Withall (2023-09-08 07:57:53)(Select): We operationalized 2 measures of physician documentation burden: clinical note length and time spent in the EHR documenting (“time in notes”). Our measure of overall note length was constructed as the average total number of characters per visit note, aggregated at the physician-week level. To measure the time physicians spent in notes, we computed a volume-adjusted measure of “active time per note” by dividing total active time in notes by the total number of notes a physician signed in each week.22 ;

Title: Tethered to the EHR: Primary Care Physician Workload Assessment Using EHR Event Log Data and Time-Motion Observations
Issue: 1544-1717 (Electronic)
Short Title: Tethered to the EHR: Primary Care Physician Workload Assessment Using EHR Event Log Data and Time-Motion Observations
Abstract: PURPOSE: Primary care physicians spend nearly 2 hours on electronic health record (EHR) tasks per hour of direct patient care. Demand for non-face-to-face care, such as communication through a patient portal and administrative tasks, is increasing and contributing to burnout. The goal of this study was to assess time allocated by primary care physicians within the EHR as indicated by EHR user-event log data, both during clinic hours (defined as 8:00 am to 6:00 pm Monday through Friday) and outside clinic hours. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 142 family medicine physicians in a single system in southern Wisconsin. All Epic (Epic Systems Corporation) EHR interactions were captured from "event logging" records over a 3-year period for both direct patient care and non-face-to-face activities, and were validated by direct observation. EHR events were assigned to 1 of 15 EHR task categories and allocated to either during or after clinic hours. RESULTS: Clinicians spent 355 minutes (5.9 hours) of an 11.4-hour workday in the EHR per weekday per 1.0 clinical full-time equivalent: 269 minutes (4.5 hours) during clinic hours and 86 minutes (1.4 hours) after clinic hours. Clerical and administrative tasks including documentation, order entry, billing and coding, and system security accounted for nearly one-half of the total EHR time (157 minutes, 44.2%). Inbox management accounted for another 85 minutes (23.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Primary care physicians spend more than one-half of their workday, nearly 6 hours, interacting with the EHR during and after clinic hours. EHR event logs can identify areas of EHR-related work that could be delegated, thus reducing workload, improving professional satisfaction, and decreasing burnout. Direct time-motion observations validated EHR-event log data as a reliable source of information regarding clinician time allocation.

Notes: Jennifer Withall (2023-09-08 07:54:01)(Select): "Scribes represent just one way to reduce documentation burden for practitioners. Improving the usability of the EHR systems; using supplemental tools, such as templates and voice recognition; and fundamentally changing documentation billing requirements, for example, by moving back to reimbursement based on time spent with patients, may individually or collectively help improve practitioner experience and satisfaction with electronic documentation. Fundamentally, if the human factor issues with electronic documentation were addressed more effectively, scribes might be unnecessary. Electronic health records are supposed to be designed in a user-centered manner, but the current EHRs get poor ratings from the human factor perspective. Documentation typically takes a lot of time and requires many clicks. --time of documentation" ;

Short Title: Virtual Scribe Services Decrease Documentation Burden Without Affecting Patient Satisfaction: a Randomized Controlled Trial
DOI: 10.1177/1938640020950544
Accession Number: CN-02177288
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Virtual scribe services (VSS) are a contemporary take on the in‐person scribes utilized as a means to reduce administrative burden on physicians and enhance the physician‐patient interaction. The purpose of this study was to determine whether VSS use could decrease the time an orthopaedic foot and ankle surgeon spends on documentation without diminishing the patient experience as compared with traditional postencounter dictation (TD). METHODS: Fifty patients presenting for first‐time visits with a single orthopaedic foot and ankle surgeon were prospectively enrolled and randomized to VSS or TD prior to the physician‐patient encounter. Time spent with the patient in the exam room and time spent documenting away from the patient were recorded. A postencounter survey assessed patient satisfaction, perception of physician empathy, understanding of the plan, and perception of the amount of time spent with the physician. RESULTS: Of 50 patients enrolled, 25 were randomized to VSS. Time spent documenting away from the patient differed significantly between VSS and TD (1.2 ± 0.7 minutes for VSS vs 5.8 ± 1.7 minutes for TD, P < .001) as did time elapsed between the end of the visit and the start of dictation (0 ± 0 for VSS vs 118.2 ± 72.7 minutes for TD, P < .001). There was a trend toward more time spent with the patient in the VSS group than in the TD group (14.2 ± 5.9 minutes for VSS vs 11.4 ± 5.1 minutes for TD, P = .069). There were no differences between groups in survey responses regarding satisfaction, empathy, understanding, or perception of sufficient time spent with the physician (P > .05 for each). CONCLUSIONS: VSS use in an orthopaedic foot and ankle practice significantly decreased documentation time and allowed for completion of documentation during patient visits without differences in quality metrics as compared to TD. Orthopaedic surgeons can consider VSS a HIPAA‐compliant documentation option with time savings and no measurable difference in patient satisfaction. LEVELS OF EVIDENCE: Level II: Randomized controlled trial.

Short Title: Quantifying and Visualizing Nursing Flowsheet Documentation Burden in Acute and Critical Care
Accession Number: 30815074
Abstract: Documentation burden is a well-documented problem within healthcare, and improvement requires understanding of the scope and depth of the problem across domains. In this study we quantified documentation burden within EHR flowsheets, which are primarily used by nurses to document assessments and interventions. We found mean rates of 633-689 manual flowsheet data entries per 12-hour shift in the ICU and 631-875 manual flowsheet data entries per 12-hour shift in acute care, excluding device data. Automated streaming of device data only accounted for 5-20% of flowsheet data entries across our sample. Reported rates averaged to a nurse documenting 1 data point every 0.82-1.14 minutes, despite only a minimum data-set of required documentation. Increased automated device integration and novel approaches to decrease data capture burden (e.g., voice recognition), may increase nurses' available time for interpretation, annotation, and synthesis of patient data while also further advancing the richness of information within patient records.
Notes: Jennifer Withall (2023-09-08 08:06:46)(Select): Clinical data capture and documentation should be: clinically pertinent, of high quality, efficient and usable, support multiple downstream uses as a byproduct of recording care delivery, enable shared decision-making and collaboration, enable collection and interpretation of information from multiple sources, and be automated whenever appropriate.1 Decreasing documentation burden across healthcare settings and professionals is a priority of several professional organizations, government agencies, and applied informatics efforts.1–4 AMIA’s report on the EHR 2020 Task Force’s first recommendation was to decrease documentation burden.4 Nurses are one of the largest users of health information technology and have some of the highest levels of documentation requirements within acute care settings. EHR design should balance capturing data to promote safety, quality, and high reliability of care, as well as patient engagement and satisfaction, while minimizing “death by data entry” for all health professionals.3 Focusing on minimizing “death by data entry” - while expanding the use of EHRs as a cognitive support tool and platform for clinicians to consume data and interpret information - is particularly important for those professions that suffer from a high documentation burden, such as nurses and physicians. ;

Short Title: We're Lost, But We are Making Good Time: Navigating Complex Pathways in a Patient-Order Management Task
Accession Number: 33936413
Abstract: Patient order management (POM) is a mission-critical task for perioperative workflow. Interface complexity within different EHR systems result in poor usability, increasing documentation burden. POM interfaces were compared across two systems prior to (Cerner SurgiNet) and subsequent to an EHR conversion (Epic). Here we employ a navigational complexity framework useful for examining differences in EHR interface systems. The methodological approach includes 1) expert-based methods-specifically, functional analysis, keystroke level model (KLM) and cognitive walkthrough, and 2) quantitative analysis of observed interactive user behaviors. We found differences in relation to navigational complexity with the SurgiNet interface displaying a higher number of unused POM functions, with 12 in total whereas Epic displayed 7 total functions. As reflected in all measures, Epic facilitated a more streamlined task-focused user experience. The approach enabled us to scrutinize the impact of different EHR interfaces on task performance and usability barriers subsequent to system implementation.

The study concluded that the documentation burden remains understudied and undermeasured in both inpatient and outpatient settings, indicating that further research is warranted.

Accession Number: 160005568. Language: English. Entry Date: 20221116. Revision Date: 20221116. Publication Type: Article
Abstract: Speech recognition technology (SRT) has increased in prevalence as a solution for providers to improve documentation but has not been widely implemented for nursing. This retrospective study suggests that SRT improves nursing documentation efficiency by decreasing time spent in flowsheets. Background: Speech Recognition Technology (SRT) has increased in prevalence as a solution for providers to improve their documentation efficiency. Because nursing documentation consists primarily of discrete data entry into flowsheets, SRT has not been widely implemented for nurses (Blackley et al., 2019). Nursing documentation, especially in flowsheets, is time consuming. Acute care nurses spend 19% to 35% of a 12-hour shift documenting in flowsheets (Collins et al., 2018). Aims: The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyze the use of SRT for discrete documentation in medical-surgical (medsurg) nursing flowsheets and to assess the impact on documentation efficiency. Method: The SRT program was implemented for nurses, including training and access to a library of voice commands for flowsheet documentation. The time spent in the shift assessment for SRT users was compared to non-SRT users at baseline and post implementation. Results: SRT users spent 9.0% to 9.7% less time documenting within the nursing shift assessment flowsheet. Limitations and Implications: The study was limited to retrospective quantitative data with implications for further research relating to nurse satisfaction, patient perceptions, and accuracy of documentation. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that SRT can provide efficiencies for nursing documentation beyond voice-to-text dictation. Clinical documentation presents a significant time burden for nurses, detracts from patient care, and contributes to clinician burnout (Ommaya et al., 2018). Acute care nurses spend 19% to 35% of a 12-hour shift documenting in flowsheets (Collins et al., 2018). Adding to the documentation time are optimization requests to create more flowsheet rows to capture standards of care. Collins et al. (2018) urged nursing informaticists to address the increasing documentation burden for nurses through technology innovations. Speech Recognition Technology (SRT) refers to software that converts speech into text. In healthcare, SRT is traditionally used by providers to dictate free-text clinical notes into the electronic health record (EHR). Providers report that SRT saves them time, increases their efficiency, and allows them to quickly document more relevant details (Blackley et al., 2020). SRT has limited implementation and research beyond providers (Blackley et al., 2019) and use cases for SRT have focused primarily on narrative notes. One of the features of SRT programs is the ability to create voice-activated macroinstructions (macros) that execute a series of keystrokes with a single voice command, such as :Create Progress Note:; however, there have been limited use cases for nursing. SRT has not been widely implemented for nurses because nursing documentation predominantly consists of discrete data entry into flowsheets. The investigators discovered a method to utilize voice commands to enter discrete nursing documentation within EHR fields for example, :Chart Normal IV Assessment".

Abstract: Social factors impact morbidity and mortality among patients. Documenting social needs in the clinical notes is currently widely done by family physicians. The unstructured format of information on social factors in electronic health records limits the ability of providers to address these issues. A proposed solution is using natural language processing to identify social needs from the electronic health record. This could support physicians in capturing structured social needs information that is consistent and reproducible without increasing documentation burden.

Abstract: Objective: To characterize variation in clinical documentation production patterns, how this variation relates to individual resident behavior preferences, and how these choices relate to work hours.Materials and Methods: We used unsupervised machine learning with clinical note metadata for 1265 progress notes written for 279 patient encounters by 50 first-year residents on the Hospital Medicine service in 2018 to uncover distinct note-level and user-level production patterns. We examined average and 95% confidence intervals of median user daily work hours measured from audit log data for each user-level production pattern.Results: Our analysis revealed 10 distinct note-level and 5 distinct user-level production patterns (user styles). Note production patterns varied in when writing occurred and in how dispersed writing was through the day. User styles varied in which note production pattern(s) dominated. We observed suggestive trends in work hours for different user styles: residents who preferred producing notes in dispersed sessions had higher median daily hours worked while residents who preferred producing notes in the morning or in a single uninterrupted session had lower median daily hours worked.Discussion: These relationships suggest that note writing behaviors should be further investigated to understand what practices could be targeted to reduce documentation burden and derivative outcomes such as resident work hour violations.Conclusion: Clinical note documentation is a time-consuming activity for physicians; we identify substantial variation in how first-year residents choose to do this work and suggestive trends between user preferences and work hours.

Abstract: Increasingly midwives are using digital technology in place of handheld records to record and document midwifery care across the continuum of care in both community and hospital settings. A rationale for this change has been the purported benefits of electronic health records (EHR) in reducing errors of omission, duplication, transcription, and interpretation that are caused by unclear, illegible, absent, and lost information. However, both positive and negative features of EHRs have been reported by clinicians. The objectives of this study were to explore midwives' experiences using the integrated electronic maternity record (EMR) and their perspectives on the impact of EMR on midwifery practice and the provision of woman-centred care. We conducted a thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with 15 midwives across two Australian tertiary public hospitals. Participating midwives cared for women across the pregnancy continuum. Midwives practiced in caseload models of care (3) and core hospital models of care (12). Midwives described a significant increase to the documentation burden since the transition from paper to EMR. An overarching theme of reconciling being with woman while being with computer emerged. Midwives described how their professional identity, embedded in their ability to be intimately present with the labouring woman, conflicted with medico-legal requirements of contemporaneous documentation and practicalities, such as the location of the computers. Midwives negotiated these competing demands to keep the woman at the centre of care. The lack of functionality of the EMR led to workflow inefficiencies, workplace tension and loss of job satisfaction. Midwives are focussed on being 'with woman' and providing woman-centred care while at the same time fulfilling their professional obligations of documentation. Midwives are well placed to make recommendations on the functionality of the EMR. Translating these findings to practice and education could lead to system improvements.

Abstract: Many states are experiencing a behavioral health workforce crisis, particularly in the public behavioral health system. An understanding of the factors influencing the workforce shortage is critical for informing public policies to improve workforce retention and access to care. The aim of this study was to assess factors contributing to behavioral health workforce turnover and attrition in Oregon. Semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted with 24 behavioral health providers, administrators, and policy experts with knowledge of Oregon's public behavioral health system. Interviews were transcribed and iteratively coded to reach consensus on emerging themes. Five key themes emerged that negatively affected the interviewees' workplace experience and longevity: low wages, documentation burden, poor physical and administrative infrastructure, lack of career development opportunities, and a chronically traumatic work environment. Large caseloads and patients' high symptom acuity contributed to worker stress. At the organizational and system levels, chronic underfunding and poor administrative infrastructure made frontline providers feel undervalued and unfulfilled, pushing them to leave the public behavioral health setting or behavioral health altogether. Behavioral health providers are negatively affected by systemic underinvestment. Policies to improve workforce shortages should target the effects of inadequate financial and workplace support on the daily work environment.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Scribes offer a potential solution to the clerical burden and time constraints felt by health care providers. OBJECTIVES: This is a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate scribe effect on patient throughput, revenue, and patient and provider satisfaction. METHODS: Six electronic databases were systematically searched from inception until May 2015. We included studies where clinicians used a scribe. We collected throughput metrics, billing data, and patient/provider satisfaction data. Meta-analyses were conducted using a random effects model and mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with adherence to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement. RESULTS: From a total of 210 titles, 17 studies were eligible and included. Qualitative analysis suggests improvement in provider/patient satisfaction. Meta-analysis on throughput data was derived from 3 to 5 studies depending on the metric; meta-analysis revealed no impact of scribes on length of stay (346 minutes for scribes, 344 minutes for nonscribed; MD -1.6 minutes, 95% CI -22.3 to 19.2 minutes) or provider-to-disposition time (235 minutes for scribes, 216 for nonscribed; MD -18.8 minutes, 95% CI -22.3 to 19.2) with an increase in patients seen per hour (0.17 more patient per hour; 95% CI 0.02-32). Two studies reported relative value units, which increased 0.21 (95% CI 0-0.42) per patient with scribe use. CONCLUSION: We found no difference in length of stay or time to disposition with a small increase in the number of patients per hour seen when using scribes. Potential benefits include revenue and patient/provider satisfaction.

Short Title: BC Medication Management Project: Perspectives of pharmacists, patients and physicians

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The BC Medication Management Project (BCMMP) was developed by the BC Ministry of Health and the BC Pharmacy Association. This pilot project ran from September 2010 to January 2012. Pharmacists reviewed patients' medication histories, discussed best use of medications, provided education and monitored for adverse effects, developed a plan to deal with medication issues and created a best possible medication history. METHODS: To evaluate the experience of participating in the BCMMP, challenges and strengths of the project and the alignment of these experiences with the overarching goals, focus groups and interviews were conducted with 6 stakeholder groups. Themes were compared within and across stakeholder type and descriptively analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 88 people participated in the focus groups/interviews. Pharmacists stated that providing BCMMP services was professionally satisfying and concurred with patients that the service did benefit them. However, participating in the BCMMP was not seen as financially sustainable by pharmacy owners, and there were concerns about patient selection. Physicians expressed concerns about increased workload associated with the BCMMP, for which they were not compensated. The computer system and burden of documentation were identified as the greatest problems. CONCLUSIONS: The BCMMP pilot project was enthusiastically received by pharmacists and patients who felt that it benefited patients and moved the pharmacy profession in a positive direction. It was widely felt that the BCMMP could be successful and sustainable if the identified challenges are addressed.
Notes: Deb Levy (2023-09-06 01:01:59)(Select): Description on bottom of column 1 on page 99 does appear to characterize the 'heavy burden of documentation that pharmacists found frustrating, time-consuming and a barrier to providing and/or documenting services. While not directly documentation burden, this does appear to give some context.;

Short Title: Clinical Documentation in the 21st Century: Executive Summary of a Policy Position Paper From the American College of Physicians
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7326/M14-2128
Abstract: Clinical documentation was developed to track a patient's condition and communicate the author's actions and thoughts to other members of the care team. Over time, other stakeholders have placed additional requirements on the clinical documentation process for purposes other than direct care of the patient. More recently, new information technologies, such as electronic health record (EHR) systems, have led to further changes in the clinical documentation process. Although computers and EHRs can facilitate and even improve clinical documentation, their use can also add complexities; new challenges; and, in the eyes of some, an increase in inappropriate or even fraudulent documentation. At the same time, many physicians and other health care professionals have argued that the quality of the systems being used for clinical documentation is inadequate. The Medical Informatics Committee of the American College of Physicians has undertaken this review of clinical documentation in an effort to clarify the broad range of complex and interrelated issues surrounding clinical documentation and to suggest a path forward such that care and clinical documentation in the 21st century best serve the needs of patients and families.

Accession Number: 125709111. Language: English. Entry Date: 20171019. Revision Date: 20171020. Publication Type: Article
Abstract: The article focuses on a study on using natural language processing (NLP) technology to reduce the clinical documentation burden. Topics discussed include challenges related to electronic health records (EHRs) for doctors, associate professor David R. Kaufman's views on reduction in the documentation burden due to NLP, and views of Amy Czahor, vice president at healthcare solutions company RecordsOne, on unstructured clinical data.
Notes: Jennifer Withall (2023-09-08 02:11:37)(Select): Undoubtedly, as more continues to be asked of physicians now than perhaps ever before, clinical documentation remains a huge burden for them. At the time of the task force report, Thomas Payne, M.D., medical director of IT services at University of Washington Medicine and chair of the task force, told Healthcare Informatics that the reason the report focused on that area is because it is causing a great deal of problems in practices. “Providers are very vocal in describing the burden this poses to them. And people who go to see those providers are also noticing that they don’t get the attention and focus that they used to,” Payne told HCI. “They see their doctor and nurse staring at a computer screen. It is lengthening the days of providers, interfering with the interaction that people have with providers and taking providers away from what they do best. That is why it is in the first set of recommendations.” ;

Accession Number: 31238022
Abstract: Detailed clinical documentation is required in the patient-facing specialty of radiation oncology. The burden of clinical documentation has increased significantly with the introduction of electronic health records and participation in payer-mandated quality initiatives. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to reduce the burden of data entry associated with clinical documentation, provide clinical decision support, improve quality and value, and integrate patient data from multiple sources. The authors discuss key elements of an AI-enhanced clinic and review some emerging technologies in the industry. Challenges regarding data privacy, regulation, and medicolegal liabilities must be addressed for such AI technologies to be successful.
Notes: Jennifer Withall (2023-09-08 02:41:05)(Select): The burden of clinical documentation on physicians has substantially increased in recent years because of multiple factors including the introduction of the electronic health record (EHR), the elimination of in-house transcriptionists, and value-based payment programs requiring the reporting of quality metrics.;

Accession Number: 157531938. Language: English. Entry Date: 20220628. Revision Date: 20220628. Publication Type: Article
Abstract: Objectives: To report quantitative and qualitative analyses of features, functionalities, organizational, training, clinical specialties, and other factors that impact electronic health record (EHR) experience based on a survey by two large healthcare systems. Materials and Methods: A total of 816 clinicians--352 (43 percent) physicians, 96 (12 percent) residents/fellows, 177 (22 percent) nurses, 96 (12 percent) advanced practice providers, and 95 (12 percent) allied health professionals--completed surveys on different EHRs. Responses were analyzed for quantitative and qualitative factors. The measured outcome was calculated as a net EHR experience. Results: Net EHR experience represents overall satisfaction that clinicians report with the EHR and its usability. EHR experience for Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center and University of Chicago Medicine was low. There were noticeable differences in physician and nursing experiences with EHRs at both universities. EHR personalization, years of practice, impact on efficiency, quality of care, and satisfaction with EHR training contributed significantly to the net EHR experience. Satisfaction of certain specialty practitioners such as endocrinology, family medicine, infectious disease, nephrology, neurology, and pulmonology was noted to be especially low. Ability to use a split-screen function to view labs, follow-up training from other providers rather than vendors, reduced documentation time burden, fewer click boxes, more customizable order sets, improved messaging, e-prescribing, and improved integration were the most common desired EHR improvements requested on qualitative analysis. Discussion: EHR experience was low regardless of the system and may be improved by better EHR training, increased utilization of personalization tools, reduced documentation burden, and enhanced EHR design and functionality. There was a difference between provider and nursing experiences with the EHR. Conclusion: Designing better EHR training, increasing utilization of personalization tools, enhancing functionality, and decreasing documentation burden may lead to a better EHR experience.

Notes: Jennifer Withall (2023-09-08 00:40:13)(Select): interchangeable use of clerical, admin, burden; Jennifer Withall (2023-09-08 00:39:41)(Select): "The emphasis on clinical workflow efficiency (a phenomenon that has seen a sharp increase in attention after the advent of the EHR) coupled with the increasing complexity of the medical record has led to an exponential increase in the amount of patient data recorded in the EHR. Not only do primary care physicians spend half their working day at the computer, about half their time in the EHR is spent engaging in clerical and administrative tasks (eg, documentation, order entry, billing, and coding) and about a quarter of the remainder of their EHR time is spent managing their inbox [8]. The clerical burden associated with EHR use, a consequence of compliance and regulatory requirements, may play a key role in promoting physician burnout [9,10]. The amount of EHR time may increase with the inclusion of more genomic and consumer data into the patient record. Combine this with a rapid rise in the use of patient portals due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the result is a “perfect storm” of excessive data and cognitive burden [11]. Some of this can be mitigated by reducing administrative requirements using regulation directed from the federal level and optimizing clinical workflows. However, the continual increase in the information needs of physicians highlights the importance of ensuring that physicians are effectively trained in how to use the EHR to effectively and efficiently perform these tasks, thus minimizing pain points [12,13]." ;

Short Title: Using Time Series Clustering to Segment and Infer Emergency Department Nursing Shifts from Electronic Health Record Log Files
Accession Number: 37128367
Abstract: Few computational approaches exist for abstracting electronic health record (EHR) log files into clinically meaningful phenomena like clinician shifts. Because shifts are a fundamental unit of work recognized in clinical settings, shifts may serve as a primary unit of analysis in the study of documentation burden. We conducted a proof- of-concept study to investigate the feasibility of a novel approach using time series clustering to segment and infer clinician shifts from EHR log files. From 33,535,585 events captured between April-June 2021, we computationally identified 43,911 potential shifts among 2,285 (74.2%) emergency department nurses. On average, computationally-identified shifts were 10.6±3.1 hours long. Based on data distributions, we classified these shifts based on type: day, evening, night; and length: 12-hour, 8-hour, other. We validated our method through manual chart review of computationally-identified 12-hour shifts achieving 92.0% accuracy. Preliminary results suggest unsupervised clustering methods may be a reasonable approach for rapidly identifying clinician shifts.
Notes: Deb Levy (2023-09-06 10:31:59)(Select): In the intro/abstract, think this offers some form of description (if not a formal definition): "In addition to the overall increase of documentation volume and information consumption contributing to documentation burden among clinicians, extensive literature has demonstrated that suboptimal EHR system design, usability, and integration of EHRs4 in clinical workflows alone are associated with more time spent on clinical documentation and burnout among clinicians.5–7 These concerns have become particularly salient during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has been accompanied by an exodus of healthcare workers from clinical medicine.8,9 ";

Short Title: Measurement of clinical documentation burden among physicians and nurses using electronic health records: a scoping review
DOI: 10.1093/jamia/ocaa325
Accession Number: 33434273
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Electronic health records (EHRs) are linked with documentation burden resulting in clinician burnout. While clear classifications and validated measures of burnout exist, documentation burden remains ill-defined and inconsistently measured. We aim to conduct a scoping review focused on identifying approaches to documentation burden measurement and their characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Extension for Scoping Reviews (ScR) guidelines, we conducted a scoping review assessing MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and CINAHL from inception to April 2020 for studies investigating documentation burden among physicians and nurses in ambulatory or inpatient settings. Two reviewers evaluated each potentially relevant study for inclusion/exclusion criteria. RESULTS: Of the 3482 articles retrieved, 35 studies met inclusion criteria. We identified 15 measurement characteristics, including 7 effort constructs: EHR usage and workload, clinical documentation/review, EHR work after hours and remotely, administrative tasks, cognitively cumbersome work, fragmentation of workflow, and patient interaction. We uncovered 4 time constructs: average time, proportion of time, timeliness of completion, activity rate, and 11 units of analysis. Only 45.0% of studies assessed the impact of EHRs on clinicians and/or patients and 40.0% mentioned clinician burnout. DISCUSSION: Standard and validated measures of documentation burden are lacking. While time and effort were the core concepts measured, there appears to be no consensus on the best approach nor degree of rigor to study documentation burden. CONCLUSION: Further research is needed to reliably operationalize the concept of documentation burden, explore best practices for measurement, and standardize its use.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Electronic health records (EHRs) are linked with documentation burden resulting in clinician burnout. While clear classifications and validated measures of burnout exist, documentation burden remains ill-defined and inconsistently measured. We aim to conduct a scoping review focused on identifying approaches to documentation burden measurement and their characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Extension for Scoping Reviews (ScR) guidelines, we conducted a scoping review assessing MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and CINAHL from inception to April 2020 for studies investigating documentation burden among physicians and nurses in ambulatory or inpatient settings. Two reviewers evaluated each potentially relevant study for inclusion/exclusion criteria. RESULTS: Of the 3482 articles retrieved, 35 studies met inclusion criteria. We identified 15 measurement characteristics, including 7 effort constructs: EHR usage and workload, clinical documentation/review, EHR work after hours and remotely, administrative tasks, cognitively cumbersome work, fragmentation of workflow, and patient interaction. We uncovered 4 time constructs: average time, proportion of time, timeliness of completion, activity rate, and 11 units of analysis. Only 45.0% of studies assessed the impact of EHRs on clinicians and/or patients and 40.0% mentioned clinician burnout. DISCUSSION: Standard and validated measures of documentation burden are lacking. While time and effort were the core concepts measured, there appears to be no consensus on the best approach nor degree of rigor to study documentation burden. CONCLUSION: Further research is needed to reliably operationalize the concept of documentation burden, explore best practices for measurement, and standardize its use. Clinicians spend a large amount of time on clinical documentation of patient encounters, often impacting quality of care and clinician satisfaction, and causing physician burnout. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) open the possibility of automating clinical documentation with digital scribes, using speech recognition to eliminate manual documentation by clinicians or medical scribes. However, developing a digital scribe is fraught with problems due to the complex nature of clinical environments and clinical conversations. This paper identifies and discusses major challenges associated with developing automated speech-based documentation in clinical settings: recording high-quality audio, converting audio to transcripts using speech recognition, inducing topic structure from conversation data, extracting medical concepts, generating clinically meaningful summaries of conversations, and obtaining clinical data for AI and ML algorithms. The implementation of the electronic health record (EHR) across the globe has increased significantly in the last decade. Motivations for this trend include patient safety, regulatory requirements, and healthcare cost containment. However, the impact of regulatory requirements and new EHRs on clinicians has increased the incidence of documentation burden and may lead to burnout syndrome. It is important to understand the extent of documentation burden and potential solutions such as EHR user-interface redesign and the use of scribes to assist healthcare providers across the world. BACKGROUND: Documentation burden associated with electronic health records (EHR) is well documented in the literature. Usability and functionality of the EHR are considered fragmented and disorganized making it difficult to synthesize clinical information. Few best practices are reported in the literature to support streamlining the configuration of documentation fields to align clinical workflow with EHR data entry elements. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to improve performance, reduce duplication, and remove nonvalue-added tasks by redesigning the patient assessment template in the EHR using best practice approaches. METHODS: A quality improvement approach and pre-/postdesign was used to implement and evaluate best approaches to redesign standardized flowsheet documentation workflow. We implemented standards for usability modifications targeting efficiency, reducing redundancy, and improving workflow navigation. The assessment type row was removed; a reassessment section was added to the first three flowsheet rows and documentation practices were revised to document changes from the initial assessment by selecting the corresponding body system from the dropdown menu. Vendor-supplied timestamp data were used to evaluate documentation times. Video motion-time recording was used to capture click and scroll burden, defined as steps in documentation, and was analyzed using the Keystrok Level Model. RESULTS: This study's results included an 18.5% decreased time in the EHR; decrease of 7 to 12% of total time in flowsheets; time savings of 1.5 to 6.5 minutes per reassessment per patient; and a decrease of 88 to 97% in number of steps to perform reassessment documentation. CONCLUSION: Workflow redesign to improve the usability and functionality decreased documentation time, redundancy, and click burden resulting in improved productivity. The time savings correlate to several hours per 12-hour shift which could be reallocated to value-added patient care activities. Revising documentation practices in alignment with redesign benefits staff by decreasing workload, improving quality, and satisfaction. BACKGROUND: Implementation of the electronic medical record (EMR) has introduced several unintended consequences, including increased documentation demands. The purpose of this study was to define the EMR documentation burden and its economic impact at a busy regional Level I trauma center, comparing attending trauma surgeons (TSs) with orthopedic surgeons (OSs), and neurosurgeons (NSs). METHODS: The EMR was queried to determine the number of attending documentation entries during 2014 for TS, OS, and NS. The eight TSs were then surveyed to estimate the time it took to write each note type, and this was used to calculate the total time needed for documentation. The hospital financial database was queried for 2014 hospital charges and work relative value units (WRVUs) for TSs, OSs, and NSs to generate a comparison. The charges and WRVUs were broken down into those generated from nonprocedural documentation and procedures. RESULTS: During 2014, there were 5,864 trauma activations with 3,111 patient admissions. The attending TSs wrote a total of 26,455 documentation entries. Of these notes, 92% were from inpatients, and 74% were progress notes. Documentation time estimates for TSs demonstrated that it took 1,760.5 hours or 73.3 twenty-four-hour days to complete these 26,455 notes. Financial data revealed that 44% of the TS charges were directly related to nonprocedural documentation, compared with 14% for OSs and 7% for NSs. Evaluation of WRVUs demonstrated that 55% of the TS WRVUs were directly related to nonprocedural documentation, compared with 28% for OSs and 19% for NSs. CONCLUSION: The EMR has introduced a significant documentation burden to the busy TSs. This documentation burden is critical for defining hospital charges and WRVUs, and it differs from that of OSs and NSs. Workflow changes, such as the introduction of scribes, may lessen the documentation burden and improve hospital charges and WRVUs of the TSs. AIM: To develop a validated tool to measure nursing and midwifery documentation burden. BACKGROUND: While an important record of care, documentation can be burdensome for nurses and midwives and may remove them from direct patient care, resulting in decreased job satisfaction, associated with decreased patient satisfaction. The amount of documentation is increasing at a time where staff rationalisation results in decreasing numbers of clinicians at the bedside. No instrument is available to measure staff perceptions of the burden of clinical documentation. DESIGN: Survey development, followed by rwo rounds of content validation (April and May 2019). METHODS: Based on the literature a 28 item survey, with items in 6 subscales, representing key areas of documentation burden was developed. Item (I-CVI), subscale (S-CVI/Ave by subscale) and overall content validity indexes (S-CVI/Ave) were calculated following two review rounds by an expert panel of clinical and academic nurses and midwives. RESULTS: Level of agreement for the first iteration of the survey was low, with many items failing to reach the critical I-CVI threshold of 0.78. No subscale reached a S-CVI/Ave above 0.8 and the overall scale only achieved a S-CVI/Ave score of 0.67. Thirteen items were removed, seven were edited and five new items added, based on the expert panel feedback, substantially improving the content validity. All individual items achieved an I-CVI ≥0.78, the S-CVI/Ave was above 0.85 for all subscales and the total S-CVI/Ave was 0.94. CONCLUSION: The Burden of Documentation for Nurses and Midwives (BurDoNsaM) survey can be considered as content valid, according to the content validity analysis by an expert panel. IMPACT: The BurDoNsaM survey may be used by nurse leaders and researchers to measure the burden of documentation, providing the opportunity to review practice and implement strategies to decrease documentation burden, potentially improving patient satisfaction with the care received. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to understand the relationship between documentation burden and clinician burnout syndrome in nurses working in direct patient care. The Office of the National Coordinator considers documentation burden a high priority problem. However, the presence of documentation burden in nurses working in direct patient care is not well known. Furthermore, the presence of documentation burden has not been linked to the development of clinician burnout syndrome. METHODS: This paper reports that the results of a cross-sectional survey study comprised of three tools: (1) The burden of documentation for nurses and mid-wives survey, (2) the system usability scale, and (3) Maslach's burnout inventory for medical professionals. RESULTS: Documentation burden has a weak to moderate correlation to clinician burnout syndrome. Furthermore, poor usability of the electronic health record (EHR) is also associated with documentation burden and clinician burnout syndrome. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that there is a relationship between documentation burden and clinician burnout syndrome. The correlation of poor usability and domains of clinician burnout syndrome implies the need for more work on improving the usability of EHR for nursing documentation. Further study regarding the presence of documentation burden and its correlation to clinician burnout syndrome should focus on specific areas of nursing to understand the drivers of documentation burden variation within and across specialty domains. OBJECTIVES: Trauma patients require extensive documentation across paper and electronic modalities. The objectives of this study were (1) to assess the documentation burden for trauma patients by contrasting entries against predetermined key information elements, dubbed 'data entry points' (DEPs) of a thorough trauma clerking, and by evaluating completeness of entries; and (2) to assess documentation for repetition using a Likert scale and through identification of copied data elements. METHODS: A 1-month retrospective observational pilot study analysing documentation within the first 24 hours of a patient's presentation to a major trauma centre. Documentation was analysed across three platforms: paper notes, electronic health record (EHR) and patient organisation system (POS) entries. Entries were assessed against predetermined DEPs, for completeness, for directly copied elements and for uniqueness (using a Likert scale). RESULTS: 30 patients were identified. The mean completeness of a clerking on paper, EHR and POS was 79%, 70% and 62%, respectively. Mean completeness decreased temporally down to 41% by the second ward round. The mean proportion of documented DEPs on paper, EHR and POS entries was 47%, 49% and 35%, respectively. 77% of POS entries contained copied elements, with a low level of uniqueness of 1.3/5. DISCUSSION: Our results show evidence of high documentation burden with unnecessary repetition of data entry in the management of trauma patients. CONCLUSION: This pilot study of trauma patient documentation demonstrates multiple inefficiencies and a marked administrative burden, further compounded by the need to document across multiple platforms, which may lead to eventual patient safety concerns. Documentation burden continues to be a critical issue in the adoption of comprehensive electronic health record systems. This case study demonstrates how the i-PARIHS framework can be applied to support the implementation of interventions in reducing documentation and EHR-related burden in a mental health context. As part of pre-adoption implementation activities for Speech Recognition Technology (SRT), a cross-sectional survey was conducted with physicians, residents, and fellows at an academic mental health hospital to explore their perceptions on SRT. Open-ended responses and follow-up interviews explored challenges and concerns on using SRT in practice. Through an analysis using the i-PARIHS framework, key considerations were mapped across the four components of the framework. This study demonstrates the value of applying well-established implementation frameworks, such as the i-PARIHS framework, in mitigating challenges related to documentation burden. Future studies should explore how implementation frameworks can be systematically embedded in addressing EHR-related burden. BACKGROUND: Documentation burden is a common problem with modern electronic health record (EHR) systems. To reduce this burden, various recording methods (eg, voice recorders or motion sensors) have been proposed. However, these solutions are in an early prototype phase and are unlikely to transition into practice in the near future. A more pragmatic alternative is to directly modify the implementation of the existing functionalities of an EHR system. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the nature of free-text comments entered into EHR flowsheets that supplement quantitative vital sign values and examine opportunities to simplify functionality and reduce documentation burden. METHODS: We evaluated 209,055 vital sign comments in flowsheets that were generated in the Epic EHR system at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in 2018. We applied topic modeling, as well as the natural language processing Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing software system, to extract generally discussed topics and detailed medical terms (expressed as probability distribution) to investigate the stories communicated in these comments. RESULTS: Our analysis showed that 63.33% (6053/9557) of the users who entered vital signs made at least one free-text comment in vital sign flowsheet entries. The user roles that were most likely to compose comments were registered nurse, technician, and licensed nurse. The most frequently identified topics were the notification of a result to health care providers (0.347), the context of a measurement (0.307), and an inability to obtain a vital sign (0.224). There were 4187 unique medical terms that were extracted from 46,029 (0.220) comments, including many symptom-related terms such as "pain," "upset," "dizziness," "coughing," "anxiety," "distress," and "fever" and drug-related terms such as "tylenol," "anesthesia," "cannula," "oxygen," "motrin," "rituxan," and "labetalol." CONCLUSIONS: Considering that flowsheet comments are generally not displayed or automatically pulled into any clinical notes, our findings suggest that the flowsheet comment functionality can be simplified (eg, via structured response fields instead of a text input dialog) to reduce health care provider effort. Moreover, rich and clinically important medical terms such as medications and symptoms should be explicitly recorded in clinical notes for better visibility. The increasing burden of documentation experienced by doctors threatens the efficiency in EDs and increases the likelihood of documentation errors. Medical scribes afford the opportunity to allay this burden by removing a large component of the doctors' documentation task. Scribes have been embedded successfully in US EDs, and the effects have been mostly advantageous. The present paper provides a brief overview of the function of scribes and their potential contribution to Australian EDs. BACKGROUND: The widespread adoption of electronic health records and a simultaneous increase in regulatory demands have led to an acceleration of documentation requirements among clinicians. The corresponding burden from documentation requirements is a central contributor to clinician burnout and can lead to an increased risk of suboptimal patient care. OBJECTIVE: To address the problem of documentation burden, the 25 by 5: Symposium to Reduce Documentation Burden on United States Clinicians by 75% by 2025 (Symposium) was organized to provide a forum for experts to discuss the current state of documentation burden and to identify specific actions aimed at dramatically reducing documentation burden for clinicians. METHODS: The Symposium consisted of six weekly sessions with 33 presentations. The first four sessions included panel presentations discussing the challenges related to documentation burden. The final two sessions consisted of breakout groups aimed at engaging attendees in establishing interventions for reducing clinical documentation burden. Steering Committee members analyzed notes from each breakout group to develop a list of action items. RESULTS: The Steering Committee synthesized and prioritized 82 action items into Calls to Action among three stakeholder groups: Providers and Health Systems, Vendors, and Policy and Advocacy Groups. Action items were then categorized into as short-, medium-, or long-term goals. Themes that emerged from the breakout groups' notes include the following: accountability, evidence is critical, education and training, innovation of technology, and other miscellaneous goals (e.g., vendors will improve shared knowledge databases). CONCLUSION: The Symposium successfully generated a list of interventions for short-, medium-, and long-term timeframes as a launching point to address documentation burden in explicit action-oriented ways. Addressing interventions to reduce undue documentation burden placed on clinicians will necessitate collaboration among all stakeholders. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) recently revised their Medicare Claims Processing Manual with the addition of CR 10412, a provision that permits teaching providers to fully bill for medical student notes. This change will have significant implications on the documentation duties of teaching physicians and trainees. Potential benefits of this provision include reduced documentation burden on house officers, improved medical student empowerment, and the infusion of more original content into the electronic medical record. However, these benefits may be offset by shifting the burden of documentation onto medical students, which may compromise their time spent with patients and overall wellness. In this perspective, we review the changes that occurred with CR 10412 and their potential impact on documentation across the medical education spectrum. BACKGROUND: Addressing clinician documentation burden through "targeted solutions" is a growing priority for many organizations ranging from government and academia to industry. Between January and February 2021, the 25 by 5: Symposium to Reduce Documentation Burden on US Clinicians by 75% (25X5 Symposium) convened across 2 weekly 2-hour sessions among experts and stakeholders to generate actionable goals for reducing clinician documentation over the next 5 years. Throughout this web-based symposium, we passively collected attendees' contributions to a chat functionality-with their knowledge that the content would be deidentified and made publicly available. This presented a novel opportunity to synthesize and understand participants' perceptions and interests from chat messages. We performed a content analysis of 25X5 Symposium chat logs to identify themes about reducing clinician documentation burden. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore unstructured chat log content from the web-based 25X5 Symposium to elicit latent insights on clinician documentation burden among clinicians, health care leaders, and other stakeholders using topic modeling. METHODS: Across the 6 sessions, we captured 1787 messages among 167 unique chat participants cumulatively; 14 were private messages not included in the analysis. We implemented a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model on the aggregated dataset to identify clinician documentation burden topics mentioned in the chat logs. Coherence scores and manual examination informed optimal model selection. Next, 5 domain experts independently and qualitatively assigned descriptive labels to model-identified topics and classified them into higher-level categories, which were finalized through a panel consensus. RESULTS: We uncovered ten topics using the LDA model: (1) determining data and documentation needs (422/1773, 23.8%); (2) collectively reassessing documentation requirements in electronic health records (EHRs) (252/1773, 14.2%); (3) focusing documentation on patient narrative (162/1773, 9.1%); (4) documentation that adds value (147/1773, 8.3%); (5) regulatory impact on clinician burden (142/1773, 8%); (6) improved EHR user interface and design (128/1773, 7.2%); (7) addressing poor usability (122/1773, 6.9%); (8) sharing 25X5 Symposium resources (122/1773, 6.9%); (9) capturing data related to clinician practice (113/1773, 6.4%); and (10) the role of quality measures and technology in burnout (110/1773, 6.2%). Among these 10 topics, 5 high-level categories emerged: consensus building (821/1773, 46.3%), burden sources (365/1773, 20.6%), EHR design (250/1773, 14.1%), patient-centered care (162/1773, 9.1%), and symposium comments (122/1773, 6.9%). CONCLUSIONS: We conducted a topic modeling analysis on 25X5 Symposium multiparticipant chat logs to explore the feasibility of this novel application and elicit additional insights on clinician documentation burden among attendees. Based on the results of our LDA analysis, consensus building, burden sources, EHR design, and patient-centered care may be important themes to consider when addressing clinician documentation burden. Our findings demonstrate the value of topic modeling in discovering topics associated with clinician documentation burden using unstructured textual content. Topic modeling may be a suitable approach to examine latent themes presented in web-based symposium chat logs. OBJECTIVE: To analyze how physician clinical note length and composition relate to electronic health record (EHR)-based measures of burden and efficiency that have been tied to burnout. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SETTING: Secondary EHR use metadata capturing physician-level measures from 203,728 US-based ambulatory physicians using the Epic Systems EHR between September 2020 and May 2021. STUDY DESIGN: In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed physician clinical note length and note composition (e.g., content from manual or templated text). Our primary outcomes were three time-based measures of EHR burden (time writing EHR notes, time in the EHR after-hours, and EHR time on unscheduled days), and one measure of efficiency (percent of visits closed in the same day). We used multivariate regression to estimate the relationship between our outcomes and note length and composition. DATA EXTRACTION: Physician-week measures of EHR usage were extracted from Epic's Signal platform used for measuring provider EHR efficiency. We calculated physician-level averages for our measures of interest and assigned physicians to overall note length deciles and note composition deciles from six sources, including templated text, manual text, and copy/paste text. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Physicians in the top decile of note length demonstrated greater burden and lower efficiency than the median physician, spending 39% more time in the EHR after hours (p < 0.001) and closing 5.6 percentage points fewer visits on the same day (p < 0.001). Copy/paste demonstrated a similar dose/response relationship, with top-decile copy/paste users closing 6.8 percentage points fewer visits on the same day (p < 0.001) and spending more time in the EHR after hours and on days off (both p < 0.001). Templated text (e.g., Epic's SmartTools) demonstrated a non-linear relationship with burden and efficiency, with very low and very high levels of use associated with increased EHR burden and decreased efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: "Efficiency tools" like copy/paste and templated text meant to reduce documentation burden and increase provider efficiency may have limited efficacy. Identifying patients' social determinants of health (SDoH) can improve patient outcomes but may increase clinicians' documentation time. However, there is limited evidence of how many physicians document SDoH and the associated burden. To address this gap, this study examines documentation of SDoH and after-hours electronic health record (EHR) work among a nationally representative sample of US office-based physicians. This was a cross-sectional analysis of the 2018-2019 National Electronic Health Records Survey. A survey design-adjusted bivariate analysis was used to estimate the prevalence of SDoH documentation and compare this activity between physicians' and practices' characteristics. A modified multivariable Poisson model was used to estimate prevalence ratios of SDoH documentation and after-hours work. The study sample included a weighted sample of 303,389 US physicians (31.5%, female; 72.5%, aged ≥50 years; 48.8% primary care specialty). Of those, 84.3% reported documenting patients' SDoH information. Physicians documenting patients' SDoH tend to be younger (<50 years). Prevalence estimates of after-hours EHR documentation were comparable between physicians recording patients' SDoH and those not (33.7% vs. 33.0%) and this difference did not reach statistical significance in adjusted analysis (adjusted prevalence ratio, 0.94, 95% confidence interval, 0.64-1.39). Thus, documenting patients' SDoH appears to be common among US physicians, and this activity is not associated with after-hours EHR documentation. Future studies should examine how patients' SDoH information is used and its association with patient health outcomes. The problem of clinical documentation burden is ever-growing. Electronic documentation tools such as "dotphrases" were invented to help with the documentation burden. Despite the ubiquity of these tools, they are understudied. We present work on the usage of dotphrases within the emergency department. We find that dotphrases are most often used by medical scribes, they significantly increase note length, and are completely unstandardized as to their naming conventions, content, and usage. We find that there is inconsistent usage across and within providers and that there is much duplication in the dotphrase content. We also show that dotphrases have no effect on the time to complete and cosign a note. Finally, we demonstrate that even when accounting for patient complexity upon presentation, note authorship, and note length - notes with higher dotphrase usage are billed at higher billing levels. OBJECTIVE: Understand the perceived role of electronic health records (EHR) and workflow fragmentation on clinician documentation burden in the emergency department (ED). METHODS: From February to June 2022, we conducted semistructured interviews among a national sample of US prescribing providers and registered nurses who actively practice in the adult ED setting and use Epic Systems' EHR. We recruited participants through professional listservs, social media, and email invitations sent to healthcare professionals. We analyzed interview transcripts using inductive thematic analysis and interviewed participants until we achieved thematic saturation. We finalized themes through a consensus-building process. RESULTS: We conducted interviews with 12 prescribing providers and 12 registered nurses. Six themes were identified related to EHR factors perceived to contribute to documentation burden including lack of advanced EHR capabilities, absence of EHR optimization for clinicians, poor user interface design, hindered communication, increased manual work, and added workflow blockages, and five themes associated with cognitive load. Two themes emerged in the relationship between workflow fragmentation and EHR documentation burden: underlying sources and adverse consequences. DISCUSSION: Obtaining further stakeholder input and consensus is essential to determine whether these perceived burdensome EHR factors could be extended to broader contexts and addressed through optimizing existing EHR systems alone or through a broad overhaul of the EHR's architecture and primary purpose. CONCLUSION: While most clinicians perceived that the EHR added value to patient care and care quality, our findings underscore the importance of designing EHRs that are in harmony with ED clinical workflows to alleviate the clinician documentation burden. Electronic health records (EHRs) have become ubiquitous tools and represent the standard of care for 96% of hospitals and 86% of ambulatory physicians in the United States. With adoption of EHRs came the promise of improved efficiency, higher-quality care, and lower costs. Unfortunately, some clinicians are now spending twice as much time on documentation as they spend seeing patients, and the documentation paradigm of problem-oriented medical records is contributing to this imbalance. It is time to consider new innovations. The collaborative wiki format offers many opportunities to ease the burden of documentation as well as to increase the usefulness of the recorded clinical data. Wikis support multiple authorship, have built-in features to track edits and changes, allow for contextual linkages (e.g., linking medical problems to their treatment), and support new technologies such as application programming interfaces, which allow for safe and secure exchange of information. In this Perspective, the authors describe the rationale for considering this approach to clinical documentation and propose a pilot to learn about its effectiveness. They believe wiki-based documentation will become increasingly attractive, especially as new legislation and directives from policymakers seek to reduce the crushing documentation burden and as the U.S. health care system transitions from an episode-based payment structure to a value-based, outcomes-focused system. Recent policy changes have required health care delivery organizations provide patients electronic access to their clinical notes free of charge. There is concern that this could have an unintended consequence of increased electronic health record (EHR) work as clinicians may feel the need to adapt their documentation practices in light of their notes being accessible to patients, potentially exacerbating EHR-induced clinician burnout. Using a national, longitudinal data set consisting of all ambulatory care physicians and advance practice providers using an Epic Systems EHR, we used an interrupted time-series analysis to evaluate the immediate impact of the policy change on clinician note length and time spent documenting in the EHR. We found no evidence of a change in note length or time spent writing notes following the implementation of the policy, suggesting patient access to clinical notes did not increase documentation workload for clinicians. During the Covid-19 pandemic, nurses requested a clean, streamlined, and intuitive view of the adult nursing assessment(s) within the electronic medical record (EMR). We created a more efficient method during a national disaster to reduce duplicative efforts and allow additional time with patients. This project was added as part of the clinically led EMR optimization strategy to eliminate unnecessary EMR assessment data elements in the adult medical, surgical, and critical care areas. This was completed in a 5-month period and decreased 20% of the data points entered by nursing. A total of 433 data points were excluded or relocated to achieve the desired result. Clinical documentation burden has been broadly acknowledged, yet few interprofessional measures of burden exist. Using interprofessional time-motion study (TMS) data, we evaluated clinical workflows with a focus on electronic health record (EHR) utilization and fragmentation among 47 clinicians: 34 advanced practice providers (APPs) and 13 registered nurses (RNs) from: an acute care unit (n=15 observations [obs]), intensive care unit (n(obs)=14), ambulatory clinic (n(obs)=3), and emergency department (n(obs)=15). We examined workflow fragmentation, task-switch type, and task involvement. In our study, clinicians on average exhibited 1.4±0.6 switches per minute in their workflow. Eighty-four (19.6%) of the 429 task-switch types presented in the data accounted for 80.1% of all switches. Among those, data viewing- and data entry-related tasks were involved in 48.2% of all switches, indicating documentation burden may play a critical role in workflow disruptions. Therefore, interruption rate evaluated through task switches may serve as a proxy for measuring burden. BACKGROUND: Virtual scribe services (VSS) are a contemporary take on the in-person scribes utilized as a means to reduce administrative burden on physicians and enhance the physician-patient interaction. The purpose of this study was to determine whether VSS use could decrease the time an orthopaedic foot and ankle surgeon spends on documentation without diminishing the patient experience as compared with traditional postencounter dictation (TD). METHODS: Fifty patients presenting for first-time visits with a single orthopaedic foot and ankle surgeon were prospectively enrolled and randomized to VSS or TD prior to the physician-patient encounter. Time spent with the patient in the exam room and time spent documenting away from the patient were recorded. A postencounter survey assessed patient satisfaction, perception of physician empathy, understanding of the plan, and perception of the amount of time spent with the physician. RESULTS: Of 50 patients enrolled, 25 were randomized to VSS. Time spent documenting away from the patient differed significantly between VSS and TD (1.2 ± 0.7 minutes for VSS vs 5.8 ± 1.7 minutes for TD, P < .001) as did time elapsed between the end of the visit and the start of dictation (0 ± 0 for VSS vs 118.2 ± 72.7 minutes for TD, P < .001). There was a trend toward more time spent with the patient in the VSS group than in the TD group (14.2 ± 5.9 minutes for VSS vs 11.4 ± 5.1 minutes for TD, P = .069). There were no differences between groups in survey responses regarding satisfaction, empathy, understanding, or perception of sufficient time spent with the physician (P > .05 for each). CONCLUSIONS: VSS use in an orthopaedic foot and ankle practice significantly decreased documentation time and allowed for completion of documentation during patient visits without differences in quality metrics as compared to TD. Orthopaedic surgeons can consider VSS a HIPAA-compliant documentation option with time savings and no measurable difference in patient satisfaction. LEVELS OF EVIDENCE: Level II: Randomized controlled trial. Documentation burden is a well-documented problem within healthcare, and improvement requires understanding of the scope and depth of the problem across domains. In this study we quantified documentation burden within EHR flowsheets, which are primarily used by nurses to document assessments and interventions. We found mean rates of 633-689 manual flowsheet data entries per 12-hour shift in the ICU and 631-875 manual flowsheet data entries per 12-hour shift in acute care, excluding device data. Automated streaming of device data only accounted for 5-20% of flowsheet data entries across our sample. Reported rates averaged to a nurse documenting 1 data point every 0.82-1.14 minutes, despite only a minimum data-set of required documentation. Increased automated device integration and novel approaches to decrease data capture burden (e.g., voice recognition), may increase nurses' available time for interpretation, annotation, and synthesis of patient data while also further advancing the richness of information within patient records. OBJECTIVES: To examine pediatricians' perspectives on administrative tasks including electronic health record (EHR) documentation burden and their effect on work-life balance and life and career satisfaction. METHODS: We analyzed 2018 survey data from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Pediatrician Life and Career Experience Study (PLACES), a longitudinal cohort study of early and midcareer pediatricians. Cohorts graduated from residency between 2002 and 2004 or 2009 and 2011. Participants were randomly selected from an AAP database (included all pediatricians who completed U.S. pediatric residency programs). Four in 10 pediatricians (1,796 out of 4,677) were enrolled in PLACES in 2012 and considered participants in 2018. Data were weighted to adjust for differences between study participants and the overall population of pediatricians. Chi-square and multivariable logistic regression examined the association of EHR burden on work-life balance (three measures) and satisfaction with work, career, and life (three measures). Responses to an open-ended question on experiences with administrative tasks were reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 66% of pediatrician participants completed the 2018 surveys (1,192 of 1,796; analytic sample = 1,069). Three-fourths reported EHR documentation as a major or moderate burden. Half reported such burden for billing and insurance and 42.7% for quality and performance measurement. Most pediatricians reported satisfaction with their jobs (86.7%), careers (84.5%), and lives (66.2%). Many reported work-life balance challenges (52.5% reported stress balancing work and personal responsibilities). In multivariable analysis, higher reported EHR burden was associated with lower scores on career and life satisfaction measures and on all three measures of work-life balance. Open-ended responses (n = 467) revealed several themes. Two predominant themes especially supported the quantitative findings-poor EHR functionality and lack of support for administrative burdens. CONCLUSION: Most early to midcareer pediatricians experience administrative burdens with EHRs. These experiences are associated with worse work-life balance including more stress in balancing responsibilities and less career and life satisfaction. This cross-sectional study uses data from the 2019 National Electronic Health Records Survey to assess the burden and time spent on medical documentation outside office hours among US physicians. OBJECTIVE: Provider burnout is a crisis in healthcare and leads to medical errors, a decrease in patient satisfaction, and provider turnover. Many feel that the increased use of electronic health records contributes to the rate of burnout. To avoid provider burnout, many organizations are hiring medical scribes. The goal of this study was to identify relevant elements of the provider-scribe relationship (like decreasing documentation burden, extending providers' careers, and preventing retirement) and describe how and to what extent they may influence provider burnout. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Qualitative methods were used to gain a broad view of the complex landscape surrounding scribes. Data were collected in 3 phases between late 2017 and early 2019. Data from 5 site visits, interviews with medical students who had experience as scribes, and discussions at an expert conference were analyzed utilizing an inductive approach. RESULTS: A total of 184 transcripts were analyzed to identify patterns and themes related to provider burnout. Provider burnout leads to increased provider frustration and exhaustion. Providers reported that medical scribes improve provider job satisfaction and reduce burnout because they reduce the documentation burden. Medical scribes extend providers' careers and may prevent early retirement. Unfortunately, medical scribes themselves may experience similar forms of burnout. CONCLUSION: Our data from providers and managers suggest that medical scribes help to reduce provider burnout. However, scribes are not the only solution for reducing documentation burden and there may be potentially better options for preventing burnout. Interestingly, medical scribes sometimes suffer from burnout themselves, despite their temporary roles. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to conduct a scholarly assessment of the information collected within the nursing admission encounter and implement content revisions across three pilot medical surgical units. The guiding principles were to preserve regulatory information, identify nurse-sensitive data, and eliminate nonessential information. The goal was to decrease the number of clicks and time expended to document electronically an acute admission encounter by 20% and to project the number of hours returned to patient care as a result of decreasing computer clicks. A second goal was to quantify the projected costs of completing a nursing admission encounter. This quality improvement project leveraged nurse executive competencies to intersect the nursing process to develop a nursing documentation praxis. This author's praxis reduced nursing documentation burden in clicks by 29% and reduced time to document on an admission encounter by 34%. This restored the focus on nurse-patient interactions by returning 1016 hours per year to patient care activities, across three pilot units, as well as quantified the costs of completing a nursing admission assessment to utilize in future cost analysis of nursing tasks. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to improve nursing documentation efficiencies and satisfaction of a pediatric admission history workflow. Secondary aims determined if defining essential data elements was associated with decreased pediatric admission history documentation time, increased dataset completion rate, and increased satisfaction. DESIGN AND METHODS: A quasi-experimental between-group difference comparison was conducted for a nurse-led quality improvement study that included implementation of a pediatric essential clinical dataset (ECD) tool for pre/post-intervention analysis of nursing admission history documentation time, dataset completion rate, and satisfaction. A survey was administered to nurses pre- and post-intervention to compare documentation satisfaction. RESULTS: Nursing admission history documentation time decreased by 1 min 31 s and the number of clicks decreased 38%. Dataset utilization increased 8% indicating improved nursing documentation of essential questions within a pediatric admission history form. Nursing documentation satisfaction with the pediatric admission history form was minimally impacted by the pediatric ECD study intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Defining what is essential for nurses to document positively influenced nursing documentation time, dataset completion rate, and satisfaction. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The study contributed to EHR content standardization, optimization, and documentation efficiencies for nurses within a pediatric organization with implications for clinical and informatics collaboration to create real-world evidence, leveraging an intervention that decreased documentation burden and increased time for children and families. Electronic health records should efficiently store the information required for clinical decision-making and contain progress notes that reference this information. However, beyond the inclusion of subjective data, objective data, assessment, and plan framework, the content required to make progress notes useful for readers with diverse specialties has not been clarified. Moreover, the documentation burden that including additional content places on medical doctors (MDs) has not been determined. We conducted a questionnaire with 74 MDs, nurses, and other clinical professionals to determine whether they found progress notes with varying specific contents useful. In addition, the degree of the burden of writing progress notes that contain specific content was measured when 25 MDs were instructed to add specific content. Our results reveal that progress notes are more useful for clinical reasoning for readers other than MDs when more specific information is included; this can be achieved without increasing the documentation burden. Guidelines for clinical documentation of evaluation and management face-to-face services were developed > 20 years ago. Recently, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) have addressed office and other outpatient services and the corresponding reimbursement, intending to reduce the amount of required documentation and to alleviate clerical burden. A CMS final rule for 2021 will eliminate the history and physical examination as criteria for level of service, allow time or medical decision-making to be used as coding criteria, and will recognize a code for prolonged service. The net effect of these changes may be some decrease in documentation burden, a change in the composition of clinical notes, and greater recognition by CMS of primary care and those who see highly complex patients requiring prolonged services. Provenance, the description of the history of a set of data, has grown more important with the proliferation of research consortia-related efforts in neuroimaging. Knowledge about the origin and history of an image is crucial for establishing data and results quality; detailed information about how it was processed, including the specific software routines and operating systems that were used, is necessary for proper interpretation, high fidelity replication and re-use. We have drafted a mechanism for describing provenance in a simple and easy to use environment, alleviating the burden of documentation from the user while still providing a rich description of an image's provenance. This combination of ease of use and highly descriptive metadata should greatly facilitate the collection of provenance and subsequent sharing of data. Data transparency has been an important aspect of medical research as it helps in enabling evidence-based decisions in medicine which leads to foster trust among the patients and research community alike. Currently, it is one of the key talking points owing to a number of initiatives taken by the pharmaceutical organizations, regulatory bodies, and the other decision enablers of the industry. Thanks to this, there are a number of ways by which a single piece of datum is available through multiple access points, namely, clinical trial disclosures (CTDs), clinical study reports (CSRs), plain language summaries, and scientific publications including abstracts, posters, and manuscripts, to name a few. This may pose a burden of documentation on the pharmaceutical organizations, demanding downsizing of medical writing documents. Since CTDs, CSRs, and other regulatory document are more or less template driven; there may not be much scope to interfere with their structure and submission timings. Scientific publications, on the other hand, provide the flexibility of presenting the clinical data that is typically not dependent on a particular format and timelines. The present paper discusses how the upcoming data transparency initiatives could affect the publication practices across the pharmaceutical industry and what could pharmaceutical companies do to get the maximum benefit out of the data transparency initiatives. BACKGROUND: Unnecessary electronic health record (EHRs) documentation burden and usability issues have negatively impacted clinician well-being (e.g., burnout and moral distress). PURPOSE: This scoping review was conducted by members from three expert panels of the American Academy of Nurses to generate consensus on the evidence of both positive and negative impact of EHRs on clinicians. METHODS: The scoping review was conducted based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. RESULTS: The scoping review captured 1,886 publications screened against title and abstract 1,431 excluded, examined 448 in a full-text review, excluded 347 with 101 studies informing the final review. DISCUSSION: Findings suggest few studies that have explored the positive impact of EHRs and more studies that have explored the clinician's satisfaction and work burden. Significant gaps were identified in associating distress to use of EHRs and minimal studies on EHRs' impact on nurses. CONCLUSION: Examined the evidence of HIT's positive and negative impacts on clinician's practice, clinicians work environment, and if psychological impact differed among clinicians. OBJECTIVE: The national developmental-behavioral pediatric (DBP) workforce struggles to meet current service demands because of several factors. Lengthy and inefficient documentation processes are likely to contribute to service demand challenges, but DBP documentation patterns have not been sufficiently studied. Identifying clinical practice patterns may inform strategies to address documentation burden in DBP practice. METHODS: Nearly 500 DBP physicians in the United States use a single commercial electronic health record (EHR) system (EpicCare Ambulatory, Epic Systems Corporation, Verona WI). We evaluated descriptive statistics using the US Epic DBP provider data set. We then compared DBP documentation metrics against those of pediatric primary care and selected pediatric subspecialty providers who provide similar types of care. One-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were conducted to determine whether outcomes differed among provider specialties. RESULTS: We identified 4 groups for analysis from November 2019 through February 2020: DBP (n = 483), primary care (n = 76,423), pediatric psychiatry (n = 783), and child neurology (n = 8589). Post hoc pairwise comparisons revealed statistically significant differences between multiple outcome-specialty combinations. Time in notes per appointment and progress note length demonstrated the strongest evidence of an increased burden on DBP providers compared with other similar provider groups. CONCLUSION: DBP providers spend a significant amount of time documenting progress notes both during and outside of normal clinic hours. This preliminary analysis highlights the utility of using EHR user activity data to quantitatively measure documentation burden. BACKGROUND: Documentation and billing/coding are essential to medical practice. Physicians spend significant time documenting to meet coding and medicolegal requirements, potentially reducing time for patient care and learning. We sought to assess time spent charting in pediatric practice and provider understanding and comfort level regarding billing/coding. METHODS: An anonymous web-based survey was emailed to members of American Academy of Pediatrics Section of Pediatric Trainees practicing in the United States. RESULTS: A total of 601 trainees responded to the survey. Thirty-seven percent of trainees spent more than half of patient encounter time documenting in outpatient settings while 62% ( P < .01) in inpatient settings. There was a positive correlation between trainees' apprehension about documentation and reporting increased stress due to documentation ( r = 0.32, P < 0.001). Sixty-two percent respondents had no prior training of billing/coding, and >70% feel necessity of including billing/coding in the medical curriculum ( P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights increasing burden of documentation in practice. Majority of pediatric trainees feel the need to including billing/coding skills as a part of medical curriculum. BACKGROUND: Substantial strategies to reduce clinical documentation were implemented by health care systems throughout the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic at national and local levels. This natural experiment provides an opportunity to study the impact of documentation reduction strategies on documentation burden among clinicians and other health professionals in the United States. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess clinicians' and other health care leaders' experiences with and perceptions of COVID-19 documentation reduction strategies and identify which implemented strategies should be prioritized and remain permanent post-pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a national survey of clinicians and health care leaders to understand COVID-19 documentation reduction strategies implemented during the pandemic using snowball sampling through professional networks, listservs, and social media. We developed and validated a 19-item survey leveraging existing post-COVID-19 policy and practice recommendations proposed by Sinsky and Linzer. Participants rated reduction strategies for impact on documentation burden on a scale of 0 to 100. Free-text responses were thematically analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 351 surveys initiated, 193 (55%) were complete. Most participants were informaticians and/or clinicians and worked for a health system or in academia. A majority experienced telehealth expansion (81.9%) during the pandemic, which participants also rated as highly impactful (60.1-61.5) and preferred that it remain (90.5%). Implemented at lower proportions, documenting only pertinent positives to reduce note bloat (66.1 ± 28.3), changing compliance rules and performance metrics to eliminate those without evidence of net benefit (65.7 ± 26.3), and electronic health record (EHR) optimization sprints (64.3 ± 26.9) received the highest impact scores compared with other strategies presented; support for these strategies widely ranged (49.7-63.7%). CONCLUSION: The results of this survey suggest there are many perceived sources of and solutions for documentation burden. Within strategies, we found considerable support for telehealth, documenting pertinent positives, and changing compliance rules. We also found substantial variation in the experience of documentation burden among participants. BACKGROUND: Although EHR systems have become a critical part of clinical care, nurses are experiencing a growing burden due to documentation requirements, taking time away from other important clinical activities. There is a need to address the inefficiencies and challenges that nurses face when documenting in and using EHRs. The objective of this study is to engage nurses in generating ideas on how organizations can support and optimize nurses' experiences with their EHR systems, thereby improving efficiency and reducing EHR-related burden. This work will ensure the identified solutions are grounded in nurses' perspectives and experiences and will address their specific EHR-related needs. METHODS: This mixed methods study will consist of three phases. Phase 1 will evaluate the accuracy of the EHR system's analytics platform in capturing how nurses utilize the system in real-time for tasks such as documentation, chart review, and medication reconciliation. Phase 2 consists of a retrospective analysis of the nursing-specific analytics platform and focus groups with nurses to understand and contextualize their usage patterns. These focus groups will also be used to identify areas for improvement in the utilization of the EHR. Phase 3 will include focus groups with nurses to generate and adapt potential interventions to address the areas for improvement and assess the perceived relevance, feasibility, and impact of the potential interventions. DISCUSSION: This work will generate insights on addressing nurses' EHR-related burden and burnout. By understanding and contextualizing inefficiencies and current practices, opportunities to improve EHR systems for nursing professional practice will be identified. The study findings will inform the co-design and implementation of interventions that will support adoption and impact. Future work will include the evaluation of the developed interventions, and research on scaling and disseminating the interventions for use in different organizations, EHR systems, and jurisdictions in Canada. BACKGROUND: Documentation burden, defined as the need to complete unnecessary documentation elements in the electronic health record (EHR), is significant for nurses and contributes to decreased time with patients as well as burnout. Burden increases when new documentation elements are added, but unnecessary elements are not systematically identified and removed. OBJECTIVES: Reducing the burden of nursing documentation during the inpatient admission process was a key objective for a group of nurse experts who collaboratively identified essential clinical data elements to be documented by nurses in the EHR. METHODS: Twelve health care organizations used a data-driven process to evaluate inpatient admission assessment data elements to identify which elements were consistently deemed essential to patient care. Processes used for the twelve organizations to reach consensus included identifying: (1) data elements that were truly essential, (2) which data elements were explicitly required during the admission process, and (3) data elements that must be documented by a registered nurse (RN). RESULT: The result was an Admission Patient History Essential Clinical Dataset (APH ECD) that reduced the amount of admission documentation content by an average of 48.5%. Early adopters experienced an average reduction of more than two minutes per admission history documentation session and an average reduction in clicks of more than 30%. CONCLUSION: The creation of the essential clinical dataset is an example of combining evidence from nursing practice within the EHR with a set of predefined guiding principles to decrease documentation burden for nurses. Establishing essential documentation components for the adult admission history and intake process ensures the efficient use of bedside nurses' time by collecting the right (necessary) information collected by the right person at the right time during the patient's hospital stay. Determining essential elements also provides a framework for mapping components to national standards to facilitate shareable and comparable nursing data. Commercial electronic health records (EHRs) were first developed to automate business processes. As EHRs developed, design principles focused on transferring existing paper-based documentation to comparable electronic forms. In addition, a strong industry focus on adult healthcare settings and quality measures has limited attention and resources for high priority EHR functionality needed for the unique health care of children. The objective of this paper is to provide a review of innovation in the EHR, that includes a variety of established and emerging technologies that may help realize a more effective EHR in child health settings. A more effective EHR would serve as an electronic hub. Existing EHR infrastructure could provide the foundation upon which new technologies and approaches branch and extend, enabling more rapid and customizable innovation to better meet shifting stakeholder and end-user needs. Among many areas for improvement, key goals of innovation could include technology that relieves ambulatory primary care clinician documentation burden, identifies needs, and supports improved care coordination and outcomes, focused on the following key areas: identification of child and family care needs, decision support, documentation, care coordination, and family communication. A focused effort is needed to capture the utility and usability of the electronic health record for providing usable and reusable data while reducing documentation burden. A collaborative effort of nurse leaders and experts was able to generate national consensus recommendations on documentation elements related to admission history. The process used in this effort is summarized in a framework that can be used by other groups to develop content that reduces documentation burden while maximizing the creation of usable and reusable data. OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate an electronic tool that collects interval history and incorporates it into a provider summary note. METHODS: A parent-facing online before-visit questionnaire (BVQ) collected information from parents and caregivers of pediatric diabetes patients prior to a clinic encounter. This information was related to interval history and perceived self-management barriers. The BVQ generated a summary note that providers could paste in their own documentation. Parents also completed postvisit experience questionnaires. We assessed the BVQs perceived usefulness to parents and providers and compared provider documentation content and length pre- and post-BVQ rollout. We interviewed providers regarding their experiences with the system-generated note. RESULTS: Seventy-three parents of diabetic children were recruited and completed the BVQ. A total of 79% of parents stated that the BVQ helped with visit preparation and 80% said it improved perceived quality of visits. All 16 participating providers reviewed BVQs prior to patient encounters and 100% considered the summary beneficial. Most providers (81%) desired summaries less than 1 week old. A total of 69% of providers preferred the prose version of the summary; however, 75% also viewed the bulleted version as preferable for provider review. Analysis of provider notes revealed that BVQs increased provider documentation of patients' adherence and barriers. We observed a 50% reduction in typing by providers to document interval histories. Providers not using summaries typed an average of 137 words (standard deviation [SD]: 74) to document interval history compared with 68 words [SD 47] typed with BVQ use. DISCUSSION: Providers and parents of children with diabetes appreciated the use of previsit, parent-completed BVQs that automatically produced provider documentation. Despite the BVQ redistributing work from providers to parents, its use was acceptable to both groups. CONCLUSION: Parent-completed questionnaires on the patient's behalf that generate provider documentation encourage communication between parents and providers regarding disease management and reduce provider workload. OBJECTIVES: The number of indicators used to monitor and improve the quality of care is debatable and may influence professionals' joy in work. We aimed to assess intensive care unit (ICU) professionals' perceived burden of documenting quality indicator data and its association with joy in work. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: ICUs of eight hospitals in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Health professionals (ie, medical specialists, residents and nurses) working in the ICU. MEASUREMENTS: The survey included reported time spent on documenting quality indicator data and validated measures for documentation burden (ie, such documentation being unreasonable and unnecessary) and elements of joy in work (ie, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, autonomy, relatedness and competence). Multivariable regression analysis was performed for each element of joy in work as a separate outcome. RESULTS: In total, 448 ICU professionals responded to the survey (65% response rate). The overall median time spent on documenting quality data per working day is 60 min (IQR 30-90). Nurses spend more time documenting these data than physicians (medians of 60 min vs 35 min, p<0.01). Most professionals (n=259, 66%) often perceive such documentation tasks as unnecessary and a minority (n=71, 18%) perceive them as unreasonable. No associations between documentation burden and measures of joy in work were found, except for the negative association between unnecessary documentations and sense of autonomy (β=-0.11, 95% CI -0.21 to -0.01, p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Dutch ICU professionals spend substantial time on documenting quality indicator data they often regard as unnecessary. Despite the lacking necessity, documentation burden had limited impact on joy in work. Future research should focus on which aspects of work are affected by documentation burden and whether diminishing the burden improves joy in work. BACKGROUND: Documentation presents an overwhelming burden to bedside clinical nurses. Nurses must manually enter several hundred data points into electronic health record flow sheets, taking time from direct patient care and introducing opportunity for documentation errors. LOCAL PROBLEM: A patient record audit revealed a significant gap in documented patient repositioning events. This quality improvement initiative evaluated automated r

Abstract: PURPOSE: To address shortcomings of human scribes (eg, turnover), clinicians are considering digital scribes (DSs). To our knowledge, to date, no study has assessed DS implementation or clinician user experience in cancer centers. We assessed the DS's feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, usability and its preliminary association on clinician well-being in a cancer center. We also identified implementation facilitators and barriers to DS use. METHODS: Using a mixed-methods longitudinal pilot study design, we implemented a DS at a cancer center. Data collection included surveys at baseline and 1 month after DS use and a semistructured interview with clinicians. The survey assessed demographics, Mini Z (workplace stress and burnout), sleep quality, and implementation outcomes (feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and usability). The interview assessed how the DS was used and its impacts on workflows and recommendations for future implementations of the DS. We used paired t tests to assess differences in Mini Z and sleep quality measures over time. RESULTS: Across nine survey responses and eight interviews, we found that although feasibility scores were slightly lower than our cutoff point (15.2 v 16.0), clinicians rated the DS as marginally acceptable (16.0) and appropriate (16.3). Usability was considered marginally usable (68.6 v 68.0). Although the DS did not significantly improve burnout (3.6 v 3.9, P = .081), it improved perceptions of having sufficient documentation time (2.1 v 3.6, P = .005). Clinicians identified suggestions for future implementations, including training needs and usability improvements. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary findings suggest that DS implementation is marginally acceptable, appropriate, and usable among cancer care clinicians. Individualized training and on-site support may improve implementation.

Abstract: Background: After‐hours documentation burden among US clinicians is often uncompensated work and has been associated with burnout, leading health systems to identify root causes and seek interventions to reduce this. A few studies have suggested quality programme participation (e.g., Merit‐Based Incentive Payment System [MIPS]) was associated with a higher administrative burden. However, the association between MIPS participation and after‐hours documentation has not been fully explored. Thus, this study aims to assess whether participation in the MIPS programme was independently associated with after‐hours documentation burden. Methods: We used 2021 data from the National Electronic Health Records Survey. We used a multivariable ordinal logistic regression model to assess whether MIPS participation was associated with the amount of after‐hours documentation burden when controlling for other factors. We controlled for physician age, specialty, sex, number of practice locations, number of physicians, practice ownership, whether team support (e.g., scribes) is used for documentation tasks, and whether the practice accepts Medicaid patients. Results: We included 1801 office‐based US physician respondents with complete data for variables of interest. After controlling for other factors, MIPS participation was associated with greater odds of spending a greater number of hours on after‐hours documentation (odds ratio = 1.44, 95% confidence interval 1.06–1.95). Conclusions: MIPS participation may increase after‐hours documentation burden among US office‐based physicians, suggesting that physicians may require additional resources to more efficiently report data.

Abstract: Electronic health records should efficiently store the information required for clinical decision-making and contain progress notes that reference this information. However, beyond the inclusion of subjective data, objective data, assessment, and plan framework, the content required to make progress notes useful for readers with diverse specialties has not been clarified. Moreover, the documentation burden that including additional content places on medical doctors (MDs) has not been determined. We conducted a questionnaire with 74 MDs, nurses, and other clinical professionals to determine whether they found progress notes with varying specific contents useful. In addition, the degree of the burden of writing progress notes that contain specific content was measured when 25 MDs were instructed to add specific content. Our results reveal that progress notes are more useful for clinical reasoning for readers other than MDs when more specific information is included; this can be achieved without increasing the documentation burden.

Short Title: It's time to change our documentation philosophy: writing better neurology notes without the burnout
DOI: 10.3389/fdgth.2022.1063141
Accession Number: 36518562
Abstract: Succinct clinical documentation is vital to effective twenty-first-century healthcare. Recent changes in outpatient and inpatient evaluation and management (E/M) guidelines have allowed neurology practices to make changes that reduce the documentation burden and enhance clinical note usability. Despite favorable changes in E/M guidelines, some neurology practices have not moved quickly to change their documentation philosophy. We argue in favor of changes in the design, structure, and implementation of clinical notes that make them shorter yet still information-rich. A move from physician-centric to team documentation can reduce work for physicians. Changing the documentation philosophy from "bigger is better" to "short but sweet" can reduce the documentation burden, streamline the writing and reading of clinical notes, and enhance their utility for medical decision-making, patient education, medical education, and clinical research. We believe that these changes can favorably affect physician well-being without adversely affecting reimbursement.
Notes: Deb Levy (2023-09-06 01:48:56)(Select): There are a mix of documentation burden and burnout references, but overall, there is significant discussion of burden on clinicians including describing components and how to address (ie: team-based documentation and it's potential impact). ;

Abstract: Background: Documentation presents an overwhelming burden to bedside clinical nurses. Nurses must manually enter several hundred data points into electronic health record flow sheets, taking time from direct patient care and introducing opportunity for documentation errors. Local Problem: A patient record audit revealed a significant gap in documented patient repositioning events. This quality improvement initiative evaluated automated repositioning documentation via a wearable sensor system. Methods: A pretest-posttest design was used to examine retrospectively collected manual documentation and prospectively collected sensor documentation of patient repositioning events in a 148-bed rural community hospital. Repositioning documentation manually entered into electronic health records during the baseline period (January 1 to February 28, 2018) was compared with automatic, sensor-based repositioning documentation during the implementation period (corresponding months in 2019 and 2020 to eliminate seasonality). Results: A convenience sample of 105 patient records was reviewed. The mean documented patient repositioning interval was 6.6 hours in the baseline period and 2.4 hours in the implementation period. The improvement was most pronounced in patients with obesity, whose mean repositioning interval improved from 9.4 hours to 2.5 hours. Documentation compliance (actual vs expected repositioning documentation) was 31% with manual documentation and 82% with automatic sensor-based documentation. Conclusions: Repositioning was documented more than 2.5 times as frequently with sensor technology as with manual data entry. Body position and reasons for delayed repositioning events were documented more completely with sensor technology. Automated documentation may improve the accuracy of electronic health records and reduce the documentation burden for nurses.
Notes: Jennifer Withall (2023-09-08 01:48:36)(Select): "Nurses experience an intense documentation burden. Recent studies have shown that nurses manually document more than 600 data points during each 12-hour shift.12 As the time spent on documentation increases, the time available for patient care decreases, which can negatively affect patient outcomes and satisfaction and often results in clinician burnout.13,14";

Abstract: The nursing shared governance clinical informatics and technology council identified that nursing admission documentation was particularly cumbersome and time consuming. The group established four guiding principles used to judge if the assessment field added value. The review resulted in a six percent reduction in the number of fields. Future activities will apply the guiding principles to other documentation sections alleviating additional documentation burden.
Notes: Jennifer Withall (2023-09-08 02:24:54)(Select): Fast forward to today, users describe current electronic documentation practices as burdensome data collection activities (Horvath et al., 2018; Ommaya et al., 2018) that ineffectively support understanding the patient story. The current documentation includes data beyond the original intent and is used for nonclinical purposes such as billing, regulatory, legal, and self-imposed artifact capture – where someone requests additional data points be collected as a method to monitor or control user behavior; Jennifer Withall (2023-09-08 02:23:54)(Select): """The National Academy of Medicine explores this issue in a discussion paper examining clinician burnout secondary to tasks that are non-value added to patient care and irrelevant to the clinician’s profession (Om- maya et al., 2018)."" ""Documen- tation burden has garnered attention since 2015 with a release by the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) of 10 recom- mendations addressing unintended conse- quences of EHRs; the first of which was to address “burdensome data entry task” (Payne et al., 2015, p. 1,102)"" ""Beyond the amount of time nurses report that documentation consumes, there are signs of cognitive burden, burnout, and ethical dilemmas surfacing in relation to documentation structure or builds.""" ;

Abstract: Background and purpose: Inconsistent documentation impedes communication and quality of care. Our aim was to develop and implement evidence-based standardized nursing care plans (SNCPs) for cardio-respiratory conditions encountered in community care settings. Methods: A Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) model was employed to guide this quality improvement project. We developed and implemented SNCPs with nurses in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. Chart audits were used to evaluate documentation after implementation (77 charts). The user perspective was obtained through informal interviews throughout implementation. Findings: Pre-intervention chart reviews (64 charts) revealed inconsistent language and absence of nursing process components thereby establishing the need for this project. The post-intervention chart audit demonstrated improved consistency linking objective data to nursing interventions. The SNCPs were easy to use and decreased perceived documentation time. Conclusions: SNCPs are a feasible method of translating evidence- based guidelines into community care nursing practice. SNCPs comprising guideline content can be used as a clinical decision support tool, quality indicators for program evaluation, and to reduce documentation burden.

Abstract: Clinical care in the United States has been transformed during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. To support these changes, regulators and payers have temporarily modified long-standing policies, recognizing the need for a trade-off between the costs and benefits of oversight during times of crisis. Specifically, there has been a heightened receptivity to the importance of preserving physicians? and other health care professionals? time, cognitive bandwidth, and emotional reserve for the direct care of patients, instead of squandering these resources on low-value tasks and frustrating technology. Instead of reflexively reverting to past practices and policies, there is now an opportunity to take advantage of the lessons of COVID-19 for the further transformation of health care to achieve Quadruple Aim outcomes (better care for individuals, better health for the population, better experience for clinicians, and lower costs). We outline some of the policy and practice changes that we believe should endure after the crisis has passed, and we recommend using similar logic during noncrisis times to make additional changes to further reduce administrative burden, and thus improve patient care.

Abstract: Background: Although EHR systems have become a critical part of clinical care, nurses are experiencing a growing burden due to documentation requirements, taking time away from other important clinical activities. There is a need to address the inefficiencies and challenges that nurses face when documenting in and using EHRs. The objective of this study is to engage nurses in generating ideas on how organizations can support and optimize nurses' experiences with their EHR systems, thereby improving efficiency and reducing EHR-related burden. This work will ensure the identified solutions are grounded in nurses' perspectives and experiences and will address their specific EHR-related needs. Methods: This mixed methods study will consist of three phases. Phase 1 will evaluate the accuracy of the EHR system's analytics platform in capturing how nurses utilize the system in real-time for tasks such as documentation, chart review, and medication reconciliation. Phase 2 consists of a retrospective analysis of the nursing-specific analytics platform and focus groups with nurses to understand and contextualize their usage patterns. These focus groups will also be used to identify areas for improvement in the utilization of the EHR. Phase 3 will include focus groups with nurses to generate and adapt potential interventions to address the areas for improvement and assess the perceived relevance, feasibility, and impact of the potential interventions. Discussion: This work will generate insights on addressing nurses' EHR-related burden and burnout. By understanding and contextualizing inefficiencies and current practices, opportunities to improve EHR systems for nursing professional practice will be identified. The study findings will inform the co-design and implementation of interventions that will support adoption and impact. Future work will include the evaluation of the developed interventions, and research on scaling and disseminating the interventions for use in different organizations, EHR systems, and jurisdictions in Canada.

DOI: 10.1007/s40746-019-00147-6
Accession Number: 31632895
Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Symptoms of burnout affect approximately half of pediatricians and pediatric subspecialists at any given time, with similarly concerning prevalence of other aspects of physician distress, including fatigue, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation. Physician well-being affects quality of care, patient satisfaction, and physician turnover. Organizational factors influence well-being, stressing the need for organizations to address this epidemic. RECENT FINDINGS: Organizational characteristics, policies, and culture influence physician well-being, and specific strategies may support an environment where physicians thrive. We highlight four organizational opportunities to improve physician well-being: developing leaders, cultivating community and organizational culture, improving practice efficiency, and optimizing administrative policies. Leaders play a key role in aligning organizational and individual values, promoting professional fulfillment, and fostering a culture of collegiality and social support among physicians. Reducing documentation burden and improving practice efficiency may help balance job demands and resources. Finally, reforming administrative policies may reduce work-home conflict, support physician's efforts to attend to their own well-being, and normalize use of supportive resources. SUMMARY: Physician well-being is critical to organizational success, sustainment of an adequate workforce, and optimal patient outcomes. Because burnout is primarily influenced by organizational factors, organizational interventions are key to promoting well-being. Developing supportive leadership, fostering a culture of wellness, optimizing practice efficiency, and improving administrative policies are worthy of organizational action and further research.

Accession Number: 33463680
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review identifying workplace interventions that mitigate physician burnout related to the digital environment including health information technologies (eg, electronic health records) and decision support systems) with or without the application of advanced analytics for clinical care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature published from January 1, 2007 to June 3, 2020 was systematically reviewed from multiple databases and hand searches. Subgroup analysis identified relevant physician burnout studies with interventions examining digital tool burden, related workflow inefficiencies, and measures of burnout, stress, or job satisfaction in all practice settings. RESULTS: The search strategy identified 4806 citations of which 81 met inclusion criteria. Thirty-eight studies reported interventions to decrease digital tool burden. Sixty-eight percent of these studies reported improvement in burnout and/or its proxy measures. Burnout was decreased by interventions that optimized technologies (primarily electronic health records), provided training, reduced documentation and task time, expanded the care team, and leveraged quality improvement processes in workflows. DISCUSSION: The contribution of digital tools to physician burnout can be mitigated by careful examination of usability, introducing technologies to save or optimize time, and applying quality improvement to workflows. CONCLUSION: Physician burnout is not reduced by technology implementation but can be mitigated by technology and workflow optimization, training, team expansion, and careful consideration of factors affecting burnout, including specialty, practice setting, regulatory pressures, and how physicians spend their time.

Short Title: Nurse Informaticians Report Low Satisfaction and Multi-level Concerns with Electronic Health Records: Results from an International Survey
Abstract: This study presents a qualitative content analysis of nurses' satisfaction and issues with current electronic health record (EHR) systems, as reflected in one of the largest international surveys of nursing informatics. Study participants from 45 countries (n=469) ranked their satisfaction with the current state of nursing functionality in EHRs as relatively low. Two-thirds of the participants (n=283) provided disconcerting comments when explaining their low satisfaction rankings. More than one half of the comments identified issues at the system level (e.g., poor system usability; non-integrated systems and poor interoperability; lack of standards; and limited functionality/missing components), followed by user-task issues (e.g., failure of systems to meet nursing clinical needs; non nursing-specific systems) and environment issues (e.g., low prevalence of EHRs; lack of user training). The study results call for the attention of international stakeholders (educators, managers, policy makers) to improve the current issues with EHRs from a nursing perspective. FAU - Topaz, Maxim

Short Title: How does medical scribes' work inform development of speech-based clinical documentation technologies? A systematic review
DOI: 10.1093/jamia/ocaa020
Accession Number: 32181812
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Use of medical scribes reduces clinician burnout by sharing the burden of clinical documentation. However, medical scribes are cost-prohibitive for most settings, prompting a growing interest in developing ambient, speech-based technologies capable of automatically generating clinical documentation based on patient-provider conversation. Through a systematic review, we aimed to develop a thorough understanding of the work performed by medical scribes in order to inform the design of such technologies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Relevant articles retrieved by searching in multiple literature databases. We conducted the screening process following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) in guidelines, and then analyzed the data using qualitative methods to identify recurring themes. RESULTS: The literature search returned 854 results, 65 of which met the inclusion criteria. We found that there is significant variation in scribe expectations and responsibilities across healthcare organizations; scribes also frequently adapt their work based on the provider's style and preferences. Further, scribes' job extends far beyond capturing conversation in the exam room; they also actively interact with patients and the care team and integrate data from other sources such as prior charts and lab test results. DISCUSSION: The results of this study provide several implications for designing technologies that can generate clinical documentation based on naturalistic conversations taking place in the exam room. First, a one-size-fits-all solution will be unlikely to work because of the significant variation in scribe work. Second, technology designers need to be aware of the limited role that their solution can fulfill. Third, to produce comprehensive clinical documentation, such technologies will likely have to incorporate information beyond the exam room conversation. Finally, issues of patient consent and privacy have yet to be adequately addressed, which could become paramount barriers to implementing such technologies in realistic clinical settings. CONCLUSIONS: Medical scribes perform complex and delicate work. Further research is needed to better understand their roles in a clinical setting in order to inform the development of speech-based clinical documentation technologies.

Abstract: This article describes the development and implementation of wellness initiatives within a large Canadian academic mental health hospital, based on the Mental Health Commission of Canada's workplace standards for mental health. To support the implementation of an organizational framework for physician wellness, a needs assessment of Centre for Addiction and Mental Health physicians (N  = 181) was conducted between 21 November and 5 December 2017, including measuring physician burnout rates using two items on the Maslach Burnout Inventory tool. Based on findings, and the organizational wellness framework, a multi-pronged wellness approach was developed, improving physician supports at the individual, team and organizational levels. Eighty-four survey responses (46% response rate) were gathered across eight clinical divisions, with 59% of respondents stating that they were negatively impacted by emotionally stressful events at work within the past year. Themes emerging from open-ended questions included the importance of a culture of safety and wellbeing, leadership accountability and availability of formal supports and processes. In response to survey findings, and our organizational framework, the following six initiatives were implemented: (i) a peer support program, (ii) an office of professionalism, (iii) individual and group mentorship opportunities, (iv) communities of practice, (v) enhanced training and leadership development opportunities, and (vi) efforts to optimize use of electronic health records to enhance efficiency of practice. It is possible to implement a multifaceted organizational approach to physician wellness, engaging physicians and continuously adapting in response to physician input. Future robust evaluation of these strategies can inform organizational roadmaps to improve physician wellness.

Abstract: A nursing efficiency project guided by the plan-do-study-act model improved nursing documentation satisfaction by 70% within 5 months of project institution.
Notes: Jennifer Withall (2023-09-08 02:46:20)(Select): Documentation burden is a prominent issue for nurses today. To solve this pressing problem, it is important first to understand the factors leading up to the increasing time nurses spend documenting. According to the American Nurses Association (ANA) (2010), nursing documentation is essential to support high quality care and that documentation is to be “clear, accurate and accessible” (p.3), but much of what nursing has been asked to document has gone well beyond those parameters.Nurses were asked to capture specific data points to track quality initiatives which increased documentation time, duplicated work, and led to inefficient workflows which potentially affected patient safety due to fewer nurse-to-patient interactions (Phillips & Baur, 2021). According to Russell and colleagues (2020), the need to satisfy billing, regulatory, legal, and self-imposed documentation demands continue to add to the nursing documentation burden. This also aligns with the American Nursing Informatics Association (ANIA) position paper addressing documentation burden (Sengstack et al., 2020). ;
