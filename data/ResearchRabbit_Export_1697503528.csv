10.1055/s-0042-1746169,35545125,,25 × 5 Symposium to Reduce Documentation Burden: Report-out and Call for Action,"Abstract Background The widespread adoption of electronic health records and a simultaneous increase in regulatory demands have led to an acceleration of documentation requirements among clinicians. The corresponding burden from documentation requirements is a central contributor to clinician burnout and can lead to an increased risk of suboptimal patient care. Objective To address the problem of documentation burden, the 25 by 5: Symposium to Reduce Documentation Burden on United States Clinicians by 75% by 2025 (Symposium) was organized to provide a forum for experts to discuss the current state of documentation burden and to identify specific actions aimed at dramatically reducing documentation burden for clinicians. Methods The Symposium consisted of six weekly sessions with 33 presentations. The first four sessions included panel presentations discussing the challenges related to documentation burden. The final two sessions consisted of breakout groups aimed at engaging attendees in establishing interventions for reducing clinical documentation burden. Steering Committee members analyzed notes from each breakout group to develop a list of action items. Results The Steering Committee synthesized and prioritized 82 action items into Calls to Action among three stakeholder groups: Providers and Health Systems, Vendors, and Policy and Advocacy Groups. Action items were then categorized into as short-, medium-, or long-term goals. Themes that emerged from the breakout groups' notes include the following: accountability, evidence is critical, education and training, innovation of technology, and other miscellaneous goals (e.g., vendors will improve shared knowledge databases). Conclusion The Symposium successfully generated a list of interventions for short-, medium-, and long-term timeframes as a launching point to address documentation burden in explicit action-oriented ways. Addressing interventions to reduce undue documentation burden placed on clinicians will necessitate collaboration among all stakeholders.","Mollie Hobensack,Deborah R Levy,Kenrick Cato,Don E Detmer,Kevin B Johnson,Jeffrey Williamson,Judy Murphy,Amanda Moy,Jennifer Withall,Rachel Lee,Sarah Collins Rossetti,Samuel Trent Rosenbloom",Applied Clinical Informatics,2022
10.1093/jamia/ocab272,34897493,,Primary care physicians' electronic health record proficiency and efficiency behaviors and time interacting with electronic health records: a quantile regression analysis.,"This study aimed to understand the association between primary care physician (PCP) proficiency with the electronic health record (EHR) system and time spent interacting with the EHR.We examined the use of EHR proficiency tools among PCPs at one large academic health system using EHR-derived measures of clinician EHR proficiency and efficiency. Our main predictors were the use of EHR proficiency tools and our outcomes focused on 4 measures assessing time spent in the EHR: (1) total time spent interacting with the EHR, (2) time spent outside scheduled clinical hours, (3) time spent documenting, and (4) time spent on inbox management. We conducted multivariable quantile regression models with fixed effects for physician-level factors and time in order to identify factors that were independently associated with time spent in the EHR.Across 441 primary care physicians, we found mixed associations between certain EHR proficiency behaviors and time spent in the EHR. Across EHR activities studied, QuickActions, SmartPhrases, and documentation length were positively associated with increased time spent in the EHR. Models also showed a greater amount of help from team members in note writing was associated with less time spent in the EHR and documenting.Examining the prevalence of EHR proficiency behaviors may suggest targeted areas for initial and ongoing EHR training. Although documentation behaviors are key areas for training, team-based models for documentation and inbox management require further study.A nuanced association exists between physician EHR proficiency and time spent in the EHR.","Oliver T Nguyen,Kea Turner,Nate C.

10.1055/s-0041-1731338,,,Which Strategies Improve Physicians' Experience with Health Information Technology?,"ObjectivesWhile electronic health records (EHRs) have improved billing efficiency and note legibility, they may also disrupt clinical workflows, affect patient interactions, and contribute to physician burnout. This study aimed to identify effective strategies, as reported by physicians, to mitigate these EHR shortcomings.     MethodsThe Rhode Island Department of Health administers a health information technology (HIT) survey biennially to all physicians in active practice statewide. The 2019 survey asked physicians about strategies implemented personally or by their practice to improve their experience working with HIT. Physicians who identified at least one strategy were then asked if each implemented strategy was “actually useful.”     ResultsThe 2019 survey was administered to 4,266 physicians, with a response rate of 43%. Both office- and hospital-based physicians most commonly reported that their practices had implemented voice-recognition dictation software (48 and 68%, respectively). Office- and hospital-based physicians identified self-care as the most commonly implemented personal change (48 and 47%, respectively). However, 26% of office-based and 15% of hospital-based physicians reported reducing clinical hours or working part-time to improve their experience working with HIT. The strategies identified as “actually useful” varied by practice setting and were not always the most widely implemented approaches.     ConclusionMost physicians reported that both they personally and their practices had implemented strategies to improve their experience with HIT. Physicians found some of these strategies more helpful than others, and the strategies identified as most useful differed between office- and hospital-based physicians. From a workforce and access perspective, prioritizing strategies that physicians find “actually useful” is critical, as many physicians in both settings reported reducing clinical hours to improve their experience.","Jacqueline Haskell,Brittany Mandeville,Emily Cooper,Rebekah Gardner",,2021

,32308916,,An Interprofessional Approach to Clinical Workflow Evaluation Focused on the Electronic Health Record Using Time motion Study Methods.,": Documentation burden has become an increasing concern as the prevalence of electronic health records (EHRs) has grown. The implementation of a new EHR is an opportunity to measure and improve documentation burden, as well as assess the role of the EHR in clinician workflow. Time-motion observation is the preferred method for evaluating workflow. In this study, we developed and tested the reliability of an interprofessional taxonomy for use in time-motion observation of nursing and physician workflow before and after a new EHR is implemented at a large academic medical center. Inter-observer reliability assessment sessions were conducted while observing both nurses and physicians. Four out of five observers achieved reliability in an average of 5.75 sessions. Our developed taxonomy demonstrated to be reliable for conducting workflow evaluation of both nurses and physicians, with a focus on time and tasks in the EHR.","Jessica M.

10.1055/s-0042-1757157,36261113,,Documentation Burden in Nursing and Its Role in Clinician Burnout Syndrome,"Abstract Objectives The purpose of this study is to understand the relationship between documentation burden and clinician burnout syndrome in nurses working in direct patient care. The Office of the National Coordinator considers documentation burden a high priority problem. However, the presence of documentation burden in nurses working in direct patient care is not well known. Furthermore, the presence of documentation burden has not been linked to the development of clinician burnout syndrome. Methods This paper reports that the results of a cross-sectional survey study comprised of three tools: (1) The burden of documentation for nurses and mid-wives survey, (2) the system usability scale, and (3) Maslach's burnout inventory for medical professionals. Results Documentation burden has a weak to moderate correlation to clinician burnout syndrome. Furthermore, poor usability of the electronic health record (EHR) is also associated with documentation burden and clinician burnout syndrome. Conclusion This study suggests that there is a relationship between documentation burden and clinician burnout syndrome. The correlation of poor usability and domains of clinician burnout syndrome implies the need for more work on improving the usability of EHR for nursing documentation. Further study regarding the presence of documentation burden and its correlation to clinician burnout syndrome should focus on specific areas of nursing to understand the drivers of documentation burden variation within and across specialty domains.","Emily Gesner,Patricia C.

10.1055/a-1868-6431,35668677,,Implementing Best Practices to Redesign Workflow and Optimize Nursing Documentation in the Electronic Health Record,"Background: Documentation burden associated with electronic health records (EHR) is well documented in the literature. Usability and functionality of the EHR are considered fragmented and disorganized making it difficult to synthesize clinical information. Few best practices are reported in the literature to support streamlining the configuration of documentation fields to align clinical workflow with EHR data entry elements. Objective: The primary objective was to improve performance, reduce duplication, and remove non-value-added tasks by redesigning the patient assessment template in the EHR using best practice approaches. Methods: A quality improvement approach and pre/post design was used to implement and evaluate best approaches to redesign standardized flowsheet documentation workflow. We implemented standards for usability modifications targeting efficiency, reducing redundancy and improving workflow navigation. The assessment type row was removed; a reassessment section was added to the first three flowsheet rows; and documentation practices were revised to document changes from the initial assessment by selecting the corresponding body system from the dropdown menu. Vendor-supplied timestamp data was used to evaluate documentation times. Video motion-time recording was used to capture click and scroll burden, defined as steps in documentation, and was analyzed using the Keystroke Level Model. Results: Results included an 18.5% decreased time in the EHR; decrease of 7-12% % total time in flowsheets; time savings of 1.5 to 6.5 minutes per reassessment per patient; and a decrease of 88-97% in number of steps to perform reassessment documentation. Conclusion: Workflow redesign to improve the usability and functionality decreased documentation time, redundancy, and click burden resulting in improved productivity. The time savings correlate to several hours per 12 hour shift which could be reallocated to value-added patient care activities. Revising documentation practices in alignment with redesign benefits staff by decreasing workload, improving quality, and satisfaction.

10.7759/cureus.26330,35911305,,Interfacing With the Electronic Health Record (EHR): A Comparative Review of Modes of Documentation,"Electronic health records (EHRs) have provided physicians with a systematic framework for collecting patient data, organizing notes from the healthcare team, and managing the daily workflow in the modern era of healthcare. Despite these advantages, EHRs have proven to be problematic for clinicians. The burdensome regulations requiring increased documentation with the EHR paradigm have led to inefficiencies from data-entry requirements forcing physicians to spend an inordinate amount of time on it, affecting the time available for direct patient care as well as leading to professional burnout. As a result, new modalities such as speech recognition, medical scribes, pre-made EHR templates, and digital scribes [a form of artificial intelligence (AI) based on ambient speech recognition] are increasingly being used to reduce charting time and increase the time available for patient care. The purpose of our review is to provide an up-to-date review of the literature on these modalities including their benefits and shortcomings, to help physicians and other medical professionals choose the best methods to document their patient-care encounters efficiently and effectively.","John P Avendano,Daniel O Gallagher,Joseph D Hawes,Joseph Boyle,Laurie Glasser,Jomar Aryee,Brian M Katt",Cureus,2022
10.1111/jep.13796,36416004,,Merit‐based incentive payment system participation and after‐hours documentation among US office‐based physicians: Findings from the 2021 National Electronic Health Records Survey,"After-hours documentation burden among US clinicians is often uncompensated work and has been associated with burnout, leading health systems to identify root causes and seek interventions to reduce this. A few studies have suggested quality programme participation (e.g., Merit-Based Incentive Payment System [MIPS]) was associated with a higher administrative burden. However, the association between MIPS participation and after-hours documentation has not been fully explored. Thus, this study aims to assess whether participation in the MIPS programme was independently associated with after-hours documentation burden.We used 2021 data from the National Electronic Health Records Survey. We used a multivariable ordinal logistic regression model to assess whether MIPS participation was associated with the amount of after-hours documentation burden when controlling for other factors. We controlled for physician age, specialty, sex, number of practice locations, number of physicians, practice ownership, whether team support (e.g., scribes) is used for documentation tasks, and whether the practice accepts Medicaid patients.We included 1801 office-based US physician respondents with complete data for variables of interest. After controlling for other factors, MIPS participation was associated with greater odds of spending a greater number of hours on after-hours documentation (odds ratio = 1.44, 95% confidence interval 1.06-1.95).MIPS participation may increase after-hours documentation burden among US office-based physicians, suggesting that physicians may require additional resources to more efficiently report data.","Oliver Nguyen,Kea Turner,Arpan Parekh,Amir Alishahi Tabriz,Karim Hanna,Lisa J.

10.1186/s12912-022-00811-7,35090442,,Nursing documentation and its relationship with perceived nursing workload: a mixed-methods study among community nurses,"Abstract Background The time that nurses spent on documentation can be substantial and burdensome. To date it was unknown if documentation activities are related to the workload that nurses perceive. A distinction between clinical documentation and organizational documentation seems relevant. This study aims to gain insight into community nurses’ views on a potential relationship between their clinical and organizational documentation activities and their perceived nursing workload. Methods A convergent mixed-methods design was used. A quantitative survey was completed by 195 Dutch community nurses and a further 28 community nurses participated in qualitative focus groups. For the survey an online questionnaire was used. Descriptive statistics, Wilcoxon signed-ranked tests, Spearman’s rank correlations and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to analyse the survey data. Next, four qualitative focus groups were conducted in an iterative process of data collection - data analysis - more data collection, until data saturation was reached. In the qualitative analysis, the six steps of thematic analysis were followed. Results The majority of the community nurses perceived a high workload due to documentation activities. Although survey data showed that nurses estimated that they spent twice as much time on clinical documentation as on organizational documentation, the workload they perceived from these two types of documentation was comparable. Focus-group participants found organizational documentation particularly redundant. Furthermore, the survey indicated that a perceived high workload was not related to actual time spent on clinical documentation, while actual time spent on organizational documentation was related to the perceived workload. In addition, the survey showed no associations between community nurses’ perceived workload and the user-friendliness of electronic health records. Yet focus-group participants did point towards the impact of limited user-friendliness on their perceived workload. Lastly, there was no association between the perceived workload and whether the nursing process was central in the electronic health records. Conclusions Community nurses often perceive a high workload due to clinical and organizational documentation activities. Decreasing the time nurses have to spend specifically on organizational documentation and improving the user-friendliness and intercommunicability of electronic health records appear to be important ways of reducing the workload that community nurses perceive.","Kim de Groot,Anke J.E. de Veer,Anne M Munster,Anneke L.

10.1055/s-0042-1756422,36104154,,Quantifying the Electronic Health Record Burden in Head and Neck Cancer Care,"Abstract Background Although the main task of health care providers is to provide patient care, studies show that increasing amounts of time are spent on documentation. Objective To quantify the time and effort spent on the electronic health record (EHR) in head and neck cancer care. Methods Cross-sectional time–motion study. Primary outcomes were the percentages of time spent on the EHR and the three main tasks (chart review, input, placing orders), number of mouse events, and keystrokes per consultation. Secondary outcome measures were perceptions of health care providers regarding EHR documentation and satisfaction. Results In total, 44.0% of initial oncological consultation (IOC) duration and 30.7% of follow-up consultation (FUC) duration are spent on EHR tasks. During 80.0% of an IOC and 67.9% of a FUC, the patient and provider were actively communicating. Providers required 593 mouse events and 1,664 keystrokes per IOC and 140 mouse events and 597 keystrokes per FUC, indicating almost 13 mouse clicks and close to 40 keystrokes for every minute of consultation time. Less than a quarter of providers indicated that there is enough time for documentation. Conclusion This study quantifies the widespread concern of high documentation burden for health care providers in oncology, which has been related to burnout and a decrease of patient–clinician interaction. Despite excessive time and effort spent on the EHR, health care providers still felt this was insufficient for proper documentation. However, the need for accurate and complete documentation is high, as reuse of information becomes increasingly important. The challenge is to decrease the documentation burden while increasing the quality of EHR data.","Tom Ebbers,Rudolf B. Kool,Ludi E. Smeele,Robert P.

10.1055/s-0041-1739518,34820789,,Clinician and Health Care Leaders' Experiences with-and Perceptions of-COVID-19 Documentation Reduction Policies and Practices.,"BackgroundSubstantial strategies to reduce clinical documentation were implemented by health care systems throughout the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic at national and local levels. This natural experiment provides an opportunity to study the impact of documentation reduction strategies on documentation burden among clinicians and other health professionals in the United States.     ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to assess clinicians' and other health care leaders' experiences with and perceptions of COVID-19 documentation reduction strategies and identify which implemented strategies should be prioritized and remain permanent post-pandemic.     MethodsWe conducted a national survey of clinicians and health care leaders to understand COVID-19 documentation reduction strategies implemented during the pandemic using snowball sampling through professional networks, listservs, and social media. We developed and validated a 19-item survey leveraging existing post-COVID-19 policy and practice recommendations proposed by Sinsky and Linzer. Participants rated reduction strategies for impact on documentation burden on a scale of 0 to 100. Free-text responses were thematically analyzed.     ResultsOf the 351 surveys initiated, 193 (55%) were complete. Most participants were informaticians and/or clinicians and worked for a health system or in academia. A majority experienced telehealth expansion (81.9%) during the pandemic, which participants also rated as highly impactful (60.1–61.5) and preferred that it remain (90.5%). Implemented at lower proportions, documenting only pertinent positives to reduce note bloat (66.1±28.3), changing compliance rules and performance metrics to eliminate those without evidence of net benefit (65.7±26.3), and electronic health record (EHR) optimization sprints (64.3±26.9) received the highest impact scores compared with other strategies presented; support for these strategies widely ranged (49.7–63.7%).     ConclusionThe results of this survey suggest there are many perceived sources of and solutions for documentation burden. Within strategies, we found considerable support for telehealth, documenting pertinent positives, and changing compliance rules. We also found substantial variation in the experience of documentation burden among participants.","Amanda J. Moy,Jessica M. Schwartz,Jennifer Withall,Eugene Lucas,Kenrick Cato,S.

10.1007/s12553-021-00568-0,34094806,,Digital scribe utility and barriers to implementation in clinical practice: a scoping review.,"Electronic health records (EHRs) allow for meaningful usage of healthcare data. Their adoption provides clinicians with a central location to access and share data, write notes, order labs and prescriptions, and bill for patient visits. However, as non-clinical requirements have increased, time spent using EHRs eclipsed time spent on direct patient care. Several solutions have been proposed to minimize the time spent using EHRs, though each have limitations. Digital scribe technology uses voice-to-text software to convert ambient listening to meaningful medical notes and may eliminate the physical task of documentation, allowing physicians to spend less time on EHR engagement and more time with patients. However, adoption of digital scribe technology poses many barriers for physicians. In this study, we perform a scoping review of the literature to identify barriers to digital scribe implementation and provide solutions to address these barriers. We performed a literature review of digital scribe technology and voice-to-text conversion and information extraction as a scope for future research. Fifteen articles met inclusion criteria. Of the articles included, four were comparative studies, three were reviews, three were original investigations, two were perspective pieces, one was a cost-effectiveness study, one was a keynote address, and one was an observational study. The published articles on digital scribe technology and voice-to-text conversion highlight digital scribe technology as a solution to the inefficient interaction with EHRs. Benefits of digital scribe technologies included enhancing clinician ability to navigate charts, write notes, use decision support tools, and improve the quality of time spent with patients. Digital scribe technologies can improve clinic efficiency and increase patient access to care while simultaneously reducing physician burnout. Implementation barriers include upfront costs, integration with existing technology, and time-intensive training. Technological barriers include adaptability to linguistic differences, compatibility across different clinical encounters, and integration of medical jargon into the note. Broader risks include automation bias and risks to data privacy. Overcoming significant barriers to implementation will facilitate more widespread adoption.

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to evaluate the time that health care providers spend interacting with electronic health records (EHR). METHODS Data are retrieved from Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations and Daily, (Ovid) Embase, CINAHL, and SCOPUS. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Peer-reviewed studies that describe the use of EHR and include measurement of time either in hours, minutes, or in the percentage of a clinician's workday. Papers were written in English and published between 1990 and 2021. PARTICIPANTS All physicians and nurses involved in inpatient and outpatient settings. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS A narrative synthesis of the results, providing summaries of interaction time with EHR. The studies were rated according to Quality Assessment Tool for Studies with Diverse Designs. RESULTS Out of 5,133 de-duplicated references identified through database searching, 18 met inclusion criteria. Most were time-motion studies (50%) that followed by logged-based analysis (44%). Most were conducted in the United States (94%) and examined a clinician workflow in the inpatient settings (83%). The average time was nearly 37% of time of their workday by physicians in both inpatient and outpatient settings and 22% of the workday by nurses in inpatient settings. The studies showed methodological heterogeneity. CONCLUSION This systematic review evaluates the time that health care providers spend interacting with EHR. Interaction time with EHR varies depending on clinicians' roles and clinical settings, computer systems, and users' experience. The average time spent by physicians on EHR exceeded one-third of their workday. The finding is a possible indicator that the EHR has room for usability, functionality improvement, and workflow optimization.","Yuliya Pinevich,Kathryn J. Clark,Kathryn J. Clark,Andrew M.

10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.15334,34279650,,Length and Redundancy of Outpatient Progress Notes Across a Decade at an Academic Medical Center.,"Importance  There is widespread concern that clinical notes have grown longer and less informative over the past decade. Addressing these concerns requires a better understanding of the magnitude, scope, and potential causes of increased note length and redundancy.  Objective  To measure changes between 2009 and 2018 in the length and redundancy of outpatient progress notes across multiple medical specialties and investigate how these measures associate with author experience and method of note entry.  Design, Setting, and Participants  This cross-sectional study was conducted at Oregon Health & Science University, a large academic medical center. Participants included clinicians and staff who wrote outpatient progress notes between 2009 and 2018 for a random sample of 200000 patients. Statistical analysis was performed from March to August 2020.  Exposures  Use of a comprehensive electronic health record to document patient care.  Main Outcomes and Measures  Note length, note redundancy (ie, the proportion of text identical to the patient’s last note), and percentage of templated, copied, or directly typed note text.  Results  A total of 2704800 notes written by 6228 primary authors across 46 specialties were included in this study. Median note length increased 60.1% (99% CI, 46.7%-75.2%) from a median of 401 words (interquartile range [IQR], 225-660 words) in 2009 to 642 words (IQR, 399-1007 words) in 2018. Median note redundancy increased 10.9 percentage points (99% CI, 7.5-14.3 percentage points) from 47.9% in 2009 to 58.8% in 2018. Notes written in 2018 had a mean value of just 29.4% (99% CI, 28.2%-30.7%) directly typed text with the remaining 70.6% of text being templated or copied. Mixed-effect linear models found that notes with higher proportions of templated or copied text were significantly longer and more redundant (eg, in the 2-year model, each 1% increase in the proportion of copied or templated note text was associated with 1.5% [95% CI, 1.5%-1.5%] and 1.6% [95% CI, 1.6%-1.6%] increases in note length, respectively). Residents and fellows also wrote significantly (26.3% [95% CI, 25.8%-26.7%]) longer notes than more senior authors, as did more recent hires (1.8% for each year later [95% CI, 1.3%-2.4%]).  Conclusions and Relevance  In this study, outpatient progress notes grew longer and more redundant over time, potentially limiting their use in patient care. Interventions aimed at reducing outpatient progress note length and redundancy may need to simultaneously address multiple factors such as note template design and training for both new and established clinicians.","Adam Rule,Steven Bedrick,Michael F.

10.1093/jamia/ocaa020,32181812,,How does medical scribes' work inform development of speech-based clinical documentation technologies? A systematic review.,"OBJECTIVE: Use of medical scribes reduces clinician burnout by sharing the burden of clinical documentation. However, medical scribes are cost-prohibitive for most settings, prompting a growing interest in developing ambient, speech-based technologies capable of automatically generating clinical documentation based on patient-provider conversation. Through a systematic review, we aimed to develop a thorough understanding of the work performed by medical scribes in order to inform the design of such technologies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Relevant articles retrieved by searching in multiple literature databases. We conducted the screening process following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) in guidelines, and then analyzed the data using qualitative methods to identify recurring themes. RESULTS: The literature search returned 854 results, 65 of which met the inclusion criteria. We found that there is significant variation in scribe expectations and responsibilities across healthcare organizations; scribes also frequently adapt their work based on the provider's style and preferences. Further, scribes' job extends far beyond capturing conversation in the exam room; they also actively interact with patients and the care team and integrate data from other sources such as prior charts and lab test results. DISCUSSION: The results of this study provide several implications for designing technologies that can generate clinical documentation based on naturalistic conversations taking place in the exam room. First, a one-size-fits-all solution will be unlikely to work because of the significant variation in scribe work. Second, technology designers need to be aware of the limited role that their solution can fulfill. Third, to produce comprehensive clinical documentation, such technologies will likely have to incorporate information beyond the exam room conversation. Finally, issues of patient consent and privacy have yet to be adequately addressed, which could become paramount barriers to implementing such technologies in realistic clinical settings. CONCLUSIONS: Medical scribes perform complex and delicate work. Further research is needed to better understand their roles in a clinical setting in order to inform the development of speech-based clinical documentation technologies.","Brian D.

,33936431,,Methods for Large-Scale Quantitative Analysis of Scribe Impacts on Clinical Documentation,"Many medical providers employ scribes to manage electronic health record (EHR) documentation. Prior studies have shown the benefits of scribes, but no large-scale study has quantitively assessed scribe impact on documentation workflows. We propose methods that leverage EHR data for identifying scribe presence during an office visit, measuring provider documentation time, and determining how notes are edited and composed. In a case study, we found scribe use was associated with less provider documentation time overall (averaging 2.4 minutes or 39% less time, p < 0.001), fewer note edits by providers (8.4% less added and 4.2% less deleted text, p < 0.001), but significantly more documentation time after the visit for four out of seven providers (p < 0.001) and no change in the amount of copied and imported note text. Our methods could validate prior study results, identify variability for determining best practices, and determine that scribes do not improve all aspects of documentation.","Michelle R.

10.2196/13313,31162125,,Unintended Consequences of Nationwide Electronic Health Record Adoption: Challenges and Opportunities in the Post-Meaningful Use Era.,"The US health system has recently achieved widespread adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems, primarily driven by financial incentives provided by the Meaningful Use (MU) program. Although successful in promoting EHR adoption and use, the program, and other contributing factors, also produced important unintended consequences (UCs) with far-reaching implications for the US health system. Based on our own experiences from large health information technology (HIT) adoption projects and a collection of key studies in HIT evaluation, we discuss the most prominent UCs of MU: failed expectations, EHR market saturation, innovation vacuum, physician burnout, and data obfuscation. We identify challenges resulting from these UCs and provide recommendations for future research to empower the broader medical and informatics communities to realize the full potential of a now digitized health system. We believe that fixing these unanticipated effects will demand efforts from diverse players such as health care providers, administrators, HIT vendors, policy makers, informatics researchers, funding agencies, and outside developers; promotion of new business models; collaboration between academic medical centers and informatics research departments; and improved methods for evaluations of HIT.","Tiago K.

DATA SOURCES: An online search of PubMed was undertaken as well as review of resources published by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Society of Critical Care Medicine, the American Medical Association, and the Association of Clinical Documentation Improvement Specialists. STUDY SELECTION: Selected publications included those that described coding, medical record documentation, healthcare reimbursement, quality metrics, administrative databases, Clinical Documentation Improvement programs, medical scribe programs, and various payment models. DATA EXTRACTION: Relevant information was extracted to highlight the impact of diagnosis documentation on patient care, perceived patient severity of illness, quality metrics, and healthcare reimbursement. Query data from our hospital's Clinical Documentation Improvement program were reviewed to highlight areas of improvement within our own Division of Critical Care Medicine. Additionally, interventions to improve clinical documentation were incorporated into this review. DATA SYNTHESIS: Available data in the literature indicate that documentation of precise diagnoses in the medical record has a positive impact on quality metrics, accuracy of administrative databases, hospital reimbursement, and perceived patient complexity. However, there is insufficient data to make conclusions regarding documentation of specific diagnoses and effects on patient care. Administrative responsibilities associated with documentation have been increasing, especially with the introduction of electronic medical records. CONCLUSIONS: Documentation of specific diagnoses in the medical record is important in the broad context of our existing medical system but there is an associated burden in doing so. Widespread implementation of electronic medical record systems has inadvertently led to clinician dissatisfaction and burnout. Research is needed to further evaluate the impact of documentation on patient care as well as steps to decrease the associated burden.","Amy L Sanderson,Jeffrey P. Burns",Critical Care Medicine,2020

Design  EHR documentation review and analysis.    Methods   S   etting  : a single academic ophthalmology department.  S   tudy population  : a cohort study conducted between November 1, 2016, and December 31, 2018, using secondary EHR data and a follow-up manual review of a random samples. The cohort study included 123,274 progress notes documented by 42 attending providers. These notes were for patients with the 5 most common primary International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, version 10, parent codes for each provider. For the manual review, 120 notes from 8 providers were randomly sampled. Main outcome measurements were characters or number of words in each note categorized by attribution source, author type, and time of creation.    Results  Imported text entries made up the majority of text in new and return patients, 2,978 characters (77%) and 3,612 characters (91%). Support staff members authored substantial portions of notes; 3,024 characters (68%) of new patient notes, 3,953 characters (83%) of return patient notes. Finally, providers completed large amounts of documentation after clinical visits: 135 words (35%) of new patient notes, 102 words (27%) of return patient notes.    Conclusions  EHR documentation consists largely of imported text, is often authored by support staff, and is often written after the end of a visit. These findings raise questions about documentation accuracy and utility and may have implications for quality of care and patient-provider relationships.","Bradley S. Henriksen,Isaac H.

10.1093/jamia/ocz220,32016375,,Electronic health records and burnout: Time spent on the electronic health record after hours and message volume associated with exhaustion but not with cynicism among primary care clinicians,"OBJECTIVES: The study sought to determine whether objective measures of electronic health record (EHR) use-related to time, volume of work, and proficiency-are associated with either or both components of clinician burnout: exhaustion and cynicism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We combined Maslach Burnout Inventory survey measures (94% response rate; 122 of 130 clinicians) with objective, vendor-defined EHR use measures from log files (time after hours on clinic days; time on nonclinic days; message volume; composite measures of efficiency and proficiency). Data were collected in early 2018 from all primary care clinics of a large, urban, academic medical center. Multivariate regression models measured the association between each burnout component and each EHR use measure. RESULTS: One-third (34%) of clinicians had high cynicism and 51% had high emotional exhaustion. Clinicians in the top 2 quartiles of EHR time after hours on scheduled clinic days (those above the sample median of 68 minutes per clinical full-time equivalent per week) had 4.78 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-20.1; P = .04) and 12.52 (95% CI, 2.6-61; P = .002) greater odds of high exhaustion. Clinicians in the top quartile of message volume (>307 messages per clinical full-time equivalent per week) had 6.17 greater odds of high exhaustion (95% CI, 1.1-41; P = .04). No measures were associated with high cynicism. DISCUSSION: EHRs have been cited as a contributor to clinician burnout, and self-reported data suggest a relationship between EHR use and burnout. As organizations increasingly rely on objective, vendor-defined EHR measures to design and evaluate interventions to reduce burnout, our findings point to the measures that should be targeted. CONCLUSIONS: Two specific EHR use measures were associated with exhaustion.","Julia Adler-Milstein,Wendi Zhao,Rachel Willard-Grace,Margae Knox,Kevin Grumbach",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association,2020
10.7326/m19-2407,31958802,,Envisioning a Better U.S. Health Care System for All: Health Care Delivery and Payment System Reforms.,"The American College of Physicians (ACP) has long advocated for universal access to high-quality health care in the United States. Yet, it is essential that the U.S. health system goes beyond ensuring coverage, efficient delivery systems, and affordability. Fundamental restructuring of payment policies and delivery systems is required to achieve a health care system that puts patients' interests first and supports physicians and their care teams to deliver high-value, patient- and family-centered care. The ACP calls for reform of U.S. payment, delivery, and information technology systems to achieve this vision. The ACP's recommendations include increased investment in primary care; alignment of financial incentives to achieve better patient outcomes, lower costs, reduce inequities in health care, and facilitate team-based care; freeing patients and physicians of inefficient administrative and billing tasks and documentation requirements; and development of health information technologies that enhance the patient-physician relationship.","Shari M.

10.2215/cjn.10190819,32184295,,Nephrology Fellows' and Program Directors' Perceptions of Hospital Rounds in the United States.,"Background and objectives  Hospital rounds are a traditional vehicle for patient-care delivery and experiential learning for trainees. We aimed to characterize practices and perceptions of rounds in United States nephrology training programs.  Design, setting, participants, & measurements  We conducted a national survey of United States nephrology fellows and program directors. Fellows received the survey after completing the 2019 National Board of Medical Examiners Nephrology In-Training Exam. Program directors received the survey at the American Society of Nephrology’s 2019 Nephrology Training Program Directors’ Retreat. Surveys assessed the structure and perceptions of rounds, focusing on workload, workflow, value for patient care, and fellows’ clinical skill-building. Directors were queried about their expectations for fellow prerounds and efficiency of rounds. Responses were quantified by proportions.  Results  Fellow and program director response rates were 73% (n=621) and 70% (n=55). Most fellows (74%) report a patient census of >15, arrive at the hospital before 7:00 am (59%), and complete progress notes after 5:00 pm (46%). Among several rounding activities, fellows most valued bedside discussions for building their clinical skills (34%), but only 30% examine all patients with the attending at the bedside. Most directors (71%) expect fellows to both examine patients and collect data before attending-rounds. A majority (78%) of directors commonly complete their documentation after 5:00 pm, and for 36%, after 8:00 pm. Like fellows, directors most value bedside discussion for development of fellows’ clinical skills (44%). Lack of preparedness for the rigors of nephrology fellowship was the most-cited barrier to efficient rounds (31%).  Conclusions  Hospital rounds in United States nephrology training programs are characterized by high patient volumes, early-morning starts, and late-evening clinical documentation. Fellows use a variety of prerounding styles and examine patients at the beside with their attendings at different frequencies.

10.1016/j.amjmed.2019.08.034,31520624,,Physician Stress and Burnout,"Abstract   Tens (or hundreds) of thousands of Americans die each year as a result of preventable medical errors. Changes in the practice and business of medicine have caused some to question whether burnout among physicians and other healthcare providers may adversely affect patient outcomes. A clear consensus supports the contention that burnout affects patients, albeit with low quality objective data. The psychological and physical impact on physicians and other providers is quite clear however, and the impact on the physician workforce (where large shortages are projected) is yet another cause for concern. We have all heard the airplane safety announcement remind us to “please put on your own oxygen mask first before assisting others.” But, like many airline passengers (very few of whom use oxygen masks correctly when they are needed), physicians often do not recognize symptoms of burnout or depression, and even less often do they seek help. We detail causes and consequences of physician burnout and propose solutions to increase physician work satisfaction.","Scott W. Yates,Scott W. Yates",The American Journal of Medicine,2020

Aim  To measure, compare and describe nurse time spent on patient care prior to, and following implementation of an integrated electronic health record roll-out using a standardised approach.    Design  Structured, continuous observation, pre-post time and motion design.    Methods  Continuous observations took place in general wards in surgical and medical divisions of a tertiary hospital in South East Queensland from November 2015 to July 2017. Trained nurse observers independently observed and recorded patient care provided by consenting direct-care nurses over the course of an entire clinical shift in surgical wards or during medication rounds in medical wards. Care activities were timed and coded into categories (direct care, indirect care, ward related activities, documentation, personal and miscellaneous activities), and additional elements that influence nursing care. Descriptive statistics including frequency, percentages and median duration were reported for care activities with differences between pre- and post-implementation reported.    Findings  Direct-care nurses (n=51) were observed for the duration of an entire clinical shift or during a medication round with a total of 6209 activities observed in both divisions. Most nursing activities occurred at the patient’s bedside prior to and following the implementation of an integrated electronic health record. In the surgical division, direct care activities (such as assessing patient needs and preparing and administering ordered medications), and ward related activities (such as cleaning and clerical work) showed a significant decrease (p=    Discussion  There was a significant increase in median time for documentation activities within an 18-month period following roll-out. However, this increase occurred as a result of the integrated electronic health record roll-out. Pre-implementation training assisted nurse adaptation. Workflows may improve as clinicians become more familiar with the digital system.    Conclusion  While the move from paper-based patient records to an integrated electronic health record did not significantly change the amount of nurse time at the bedside, or for the preparation and administration of ordered medications, there was a clear and consistent trend of increased documentation time and activities following implementation of the electronic health record. This knowledge may assist nurse leaders when implementing electronic health records.","Rachel Walker,Elizabeth Burmeister,Carol Jeffrey,Sean Birgan,Elizabeth Garrahy,Jenny Andrews,Adriana Hada,Leanne M.

10.7812/tpp/18-221,31314721,,A Daily Hospital Progress Note that Increases Physician Usability of the Electronic Health Record by Facilitating a Problem-Oriented Approach to the Patient and Reducing Physician Clerical Burden,"We suggest changes in the electronic health record (EHR) in hospitalized patients to increase EHR usability by optimizing the physician’s ability to approach the patient in a problem-oriented fashion and by reducing physician data entry and chart navigation. The framework for these changes is a Physician’s Daily Hospital Progress Note organized into 3 sections: Subjective, Objective, and a combined Assessment and Plan section, subdivided by problem titles. The EHR would consolidate information for each problem by: 1) juxtaposing to each problem title relevant medications, key durable results, and limitations; 2) entering in the running lists under Assessment and Plan the most relevant information for that day, including abbreviated versions of relevant reports; and 3) generating a flow sheet in a problem’s progress note for any key results tracked daily. To reduce physician EHR navigation, the EHR would place in the Objective section abbreviated versions of notes of other physicians, nurses, and allied health professionals as well as recent orders. The physician would enter only the analysis and plan and new information not included in the EHR. The consolidation of information for each problem would facilitate physician communication at points of transition of care including generation of a problem-oriented discharge summary.","James Sutton,Sutton Jm,James M Sutton,Ash,Steven R Ash,Al Makki A,Akram Al Makki,Rabih Kalakeche,Rabih Kalakeche,Kalakeche R",The Permanente Journal,2019

The goal of this study was to examine how the amount of time spent using EHRs as well as related documentation behaviors changed 1 decade after EHR adoption.    Design  Single-center cohort study.    Participants  Six hundred eighty-five thousand three hundred sixty-one office visits with 70 ophthalmology providers.    Methods  We calculated time spent using the EHR associated with each individual office visit using EHR audit logs and determined chart closure times and progress note length from secondary EHR data. We tracked and modeled how these metrics changed from 2006 to 2016 with linear mixed models.    Main Outcome Measures  Minutes spent using the EHR associated with an office visit, chart closure time in hours from the office visit check-in time, and progress note length in characters.    Results  Median EHR time per office visit in 2006 was 4.2 minutes (interquartile range [IQR], 3.5 minutes), and increased to 6.4 minutes (IQR, 4.5 minutes) in 2016. Median chart closure time was 2.8 hours (IQR, 21.3 hours) in 2006 and decreased to 2.3 hours (IQR, 18.5 hours) in 2016. In 2006, median note length was 1530 characters (IQR, 1435 characters) and increased to 3838 characters (IQR, 2668.3 characters) in 2016. Linear mixed models found EHR time per office visit was 31.9±0.2% (P     Conclusions  After 1 decade of use, providers spend more time using the EHR for an office visit, generate longer notes, and close the chart faster. These changes are likely to represent increased time and documentation pressure for providers.

In medicine—including diabetes care and research—big data come from three main sources: electronic medical records (EMRs), surveys and registries, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). These systems have evolved in different ways, each with strengths and limitations. EMRs continuously accumulate information about patients and make it readily accessible but are limited by missing data or data that are not quality assured. Because EMRs vary in structure and management, comparisons of data between health systems may be difficult. Registries and surveys provide data that are consistently collected and representative of broad populations but are limited in scope and may be updated only intermittently. RCT databases excel in the specificity, completeness, and accuracy of their data, but rarely include a fully representative sample of the general population. Also, they are costly to build and seldom maintained after a trial’s end. To consider these issues, and the challenges and opportunities they present, the editors of Diabetes Care convened a group of experts in management of diabetes-related data on 21 June 2018, in conjunction with the American Diabetes Association’s 78th Scientific Sessions in Orlando, FL.

Aggregative electronic health record (EHR) dashboards may help to reduce consultation turnaround time (TAT) which may reflect time spent interfacing with the EHR.     ObjectivesThis study was aimed to measure the difference in TAT before and after the implementation of a neurological dashboard.     MethodsWe retrospectively studied a neurological dashboard in a read-only, web-based, clinical data review platform at an academic medical center that was separate from our institutional EHR. Using our EHR, we identified all distinct initial neurological consultations at our institution that were completed in the 5 months before, 5 months after, and 12 months after the dashboard go-live in December 2017. Using log data, we determined total dashboard users, unique page hits, patient-chart accesses, and user departments at 5 months after go-live. We calculated TAT as the difference in time between the placement of the consultation order and completion of the consultation note in the EHR.     ResultsBy April 30th in 2018, we identified 269 unique users, 684 dashboard page hits (median hits/user 1.0, interquartile range [IQR]=1.0), and 510 unique patient-chart accesses. In 5 months before the go-live, 1,434 neurology consultations were completed with a median TAT of 2.0hours (IQR=2.5) which was significantly longer than during 5 months after the go-live, with 1,672 neurology consultations completed with a median TAT of 1.8hours (IQR=2.2; p=0.001). Over the following 7 months, 2,160 consultations were completed and median TAT remained unchanged at 1.8hours (IQR=2.5).     ConclusionAt a large academic institution, we found a significant decrease in inpatient consult TAT 5 and 12 months after the implementation of a neurological dashboard. Further study is necessary to investigate the cognitive and operational effects of aggregative dashboards in neurology and to optimize their use.","Benjamin R Kummer,Joshua Z. Willey,Michael J.

10.1093/jamia/ocy145,30517663,,Physician stress and burnout: the impact of health information technology.,"Objective: To quantify how stress related to use of health information technology (HIT) predicts burnout among physicians. Methods: All 4197 practicing physicians in Rhode Island were surveyed in 2017 on their HIT use. Our main outcome was self-reported burnout. The presence of HIT-related stress was defined by report of at least 1 of the following: poor/marginal time for documentation, moderately high/excessive time spent on the electronic health record (EHR) at home, and agreement that using an EHR adds to daily frustration. We used logistic regression to assess the association between each HIT-related stress measure and burnout, adjusting for respondent demographics, practice characteristics, and the other stress measures. Results: Of the 1792 physician respondents (43% response rate), 26% reported burnout. Among EHR users (91%), 70% reported HIT-related stress, with the highest prevalence in primary care-oriented specialties. After adjustment, physicians reporting poor/marginal time for documentation had 2.8 times the odds of burnout (95% CI: 2.0-4.1; P<.0001), compared to those reporting sufficient time. Physicians reporting moderately high/excessive time on EHRs at home had 1.9 times the odds of burnout (95% CI: 1.4-2.8; P<.0001), compared to those with minimal/no EHR use at home. Those who agreed that EHRs add to their daily frustration had 2.4 times the odds of burnout (95% CI: 1.6-3.7; P<.0001), compared to those who disagreed. Conclusion: HIT-related stress is measurable, common (about 70% among respondents), specialty-related, and independently predictive of burnout symptoms. Identifying HIT-specific factors associated with burnout may guide healthcare organizations seeking to measure and remediate burnout among their physicians and staff.","Rebekah Gardner,Emily Cooper,Emily Cooper,Jacqueline Haskell,Daniel A.

10.1007/978-3-030-16916-9_8,,,Reengineering Approaches for Learning Health Systems: Applications in Nursing Research to Learn from Safety Information Gaps and Workarounds to Overcome Electronic Health Record Silos,"Health systems engineering is an approach to effectively implement a learning health system to drive more efficient and safer care by adapting and aligning individual structures (e.g., applications) and processes (e.g., workflows) to optimize outcomes within a “system of systems”. Nurses have been described as particularly adept at identifying and utilizing workarounds to overcome poor system design. Workflows and workarounds are not limited to directly observable patient care activities; they also occur within documentation activities and can be modeled using metadata (data about data) from clinical information systems. This chapter will outline 3 broad approaches that can be triangulated within a systems engineering framework to reengineer nursing and patient care workflows and overcome information silos by actively learning from safety information gaps and workarounds within a health system: (1) “In the lab” participatory design and usability evaluation, (2) “In the wild” observations, and (3) “In the metadata” models of health care processes. Systems engineering methods can be applied to a broad range of healthcare processes to model workflow, data and information flow to support the development, integration, and optimization of health IT applications leveraging a 5-phase approach: problem analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation. In this chapter we present use cases of pragmatic applications grounded in theoretical and methodological approaches within a systems engineering framework that demonstrate the iterative nature of health IT evaluation. This chapter highlights the complexity of nursing and patient care workflows and the fact that even well-designed systems that adequately address socio-technical dimensions as part of the development process, require continued attention to workflow during and after implementation. Post-implementation attention to end-users’ concerns and feedback provides an opportunity for system optimization. Secondary analysis of EHR data after implementation can provide important clues about alignment with documentation workflows, effective information flow, and accurate data interpretation. These activities are needed to achieve a learning health care system and can be achieved if nursing domain experts work closely with data science experts throughout the system lifecycle to contextualize clinical analyses and help to successfully convert data into knowledge.","Sarah Collins Rossetti,Po-Yin Yen,Patricia C.

10.2196/17585,,,Self-Perceptions of Readiness to Use Electronic Health Records Among Medical Students: Survey Study,"BACKGROUND: Although several national organizations have declared the ability to work with electronic health records (EHRs) as a core competency of medical education, EHR education and use among medical students vary widely. Previous studies have reported EHR tasks performed by medical students, but students' self-perceived readiness and comfort with EHRs are relatively unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to better understand medical students' self-perceived readiness to use EHRs to identify potential curricular gaps and inform future training efforts based on students' perspectives. METHODS: The authors deployed a survey investigating self-perceived comfort with EHRs at 2 institutions in the United States in May 2019. Descriptive statistics were generated regarding demographics, comfort level with various EHR-related tasks, and cross-institutional comparisons. We also assessed the impact of extracurricular EHR experience on comfort level. RESULTS: In total, 147 medical students responded, of which 80 (54.4%) were female, with equal distribution across all 4 years of training. Overall confidence was generally higher for students with longer extracurricular EHR experience, even when adjusted for age, gender, year of training, and institution. Students were most comfortable with tasks related to looking up information in the EHR and felt less comfortable with tasks related to entering new information and managing medications. Fourth-year students at both schools reported similar levels of comfort with EHR use, despite differences in preclinical EHR training. Open-ended comments emphasized the value of experiential training over didactic formats. CONCLUSIONS: Information entry and medication management in the EHR represent areas for future curricular development. Experiential training via extracurricular activities and early clinical exposure may be high-yield approaches to help medical students achieve critical EHR competencies.","Lina Lander,Sally L.

10.1016/j.ajo.2019.03.014,30910517,,Time Requirements of Paper-Based Clinical Workflows and After-Hours Documentation in a Multispecialty Academic Ophthalmology Practice.,"Purpose  To assess time requirements for patient encounters and estimate after-hours demands of paper-based clinical workflows in ophthalmology.    Design  Time-and-motion study with a structured survey.    Methods  This study was conducted in a single academic ophthalmology department. A convenience sample consisted of 7 attending ophthalmologists from 6 subspecialties observed during 414 patient encounters for the time-motion analysis and 12 attending ophthalmologists for the survey. Outcome measurements consisted of total time spent by attending ophthalmologists per patient and time spent on documentation, examination, and talking with patients. The survey assessed time requirements of documentation-related activities performed outside of scheduled clinic hours.    Results  Among the 7 attending ophthalmologists observed (6 men and 1 woman), mean ± SD age 43.9 ±7.1 years, during encounters with 414 patients (57.8 ± 24.6 years of age), total time spent per patient was 8.1 ± 4.8minutes, with 2.8 ± 1.4minutes (38%) for documentation, 1.2 ± 0.9minutes (17%) for examination, and 3.3 ± 3.1minutes (37%) for talking with patients. New patient evaluations required significantly more time than routine follow-up visits and postoperative visits. Higher clinical volumes were associated with less time per patient. Survey results indicated that paper-based documentation was associated with minimal after-hours work on weeknights and weekends.    Conclusions  Paper-based documentation takes up a substantial portion of the total time spent for patient care in outpatient ophthalmology clinics but is associated with minimal after-hours work. Understanding paper-based clinical workflows may help inform targeted strategies for improving electronic health record use in ophthalmology.","Sally L. Baxter,Helena E. Gali,Abigail E.

10.1001/jamainternmed.2018.3956,30242380,,Association of Medical Scribes in Primary Care With Physician Workflow and Patient Experience.,"Importance  Widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) in medical care has resulted in increased physician documentation workload and decreased interaction with patients. Despite the increasing use of medical scribes for EHR documentation assistance, few methodologically rigorous studies have examined the use of medical scribes in primary care.  Objective  To evaluate the association of use of medical scribes with primary care physician (PCP) workflow and patient experience.  Design, Setting, and Participants  This 12-month crossover study with 2 sequences and 4 periods was conducted from July 1, 2016, to June 30, 2017, in 2 medical center facilities within an integrated health care system and included 18 of 24 eligible PCPs.  Interventions  The PCPs were randomly assigned to start the first 3-month period with or without scribes and then alternated exposure status every 3 months for 1 year, thereby serving as their own controls. The PCPs completed a 6-question survey at the end of each study period. Patients of participating PCPs were surveyed after scribed clinic visits.  Main Outcomes and Measures  PCP-reported perceptions of documentation burden and visit interactions, objective measures of time spent on EHR activity and required for closing encounters, and patient-reported perceptions of visit quality.  Results  Of the 18 participating PCPs, 10 were women, 12 were internal medicine physicians, and 6 were family practice physicians. The PCPs graduated from medical school a mean (SD) of 13.7 (6.5) years before the study start date. Compared with nonscribed periods, scribed periods were associated with less self-reported after-hours EHR documentation ( 900) and less than 25% of the visit on a computer (aOR, 31.5; 95% CI, 7.3-136.4). Encounter documentation was more likely to be completed by the end of the next business day during scribed periods (aOR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.2-7.1). A total of 450 of 735 patients (61.2%) reported that scribes had a positive bearing on their visits; only 2.4% reported a negative bearing.  Conclusions and Relevance  Medical scribes were associated with decreased physician EHR documentation burden, improved work efficiency, and improved visit interactions. Our results support the use of medical scribes as one strategy for improving physician workflow and visit quality in primary care.","Pranita Mishra,Jacqueline C. Kiang,Richard W.

10.2196/10762,29929947,,Patient Acceptance of Remote Scribing Powered by Google Glass in Outpatient Dermatology: Cross-Sectional Study,"BACKGROUND: The ubiquitous use of electronic health records (EHRs) during medical office visits using a computer monitor and keyboard can be distracting and can disrupt patient-health care provider (HCP) nonverbal eye contact cues, which are integral to effective communication. Provider use of a remote medical scribe with face-mounted technology (FMT), such as Google Glass, may preserve patient-HCP communication dynamics in health care settings by allowing providers to maintain direct eye contact with their patients while still having access to the patient's relevant EHR information. The medical scribe is able to chart patient encounters in real-time working in an offsite location, document the visit directly into EHR, and free HCP to focus only on the patient. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine patient perceptions of their interactions with an HCP who used FMT with a remote medical scribe during office visits. This includes an examination of any association between patient privacy and trust in their HCP when FMT is used in the medical office setting. METHODS: For this descriptive, cross-sectional study, a convenience sample of patients was recruited from an outpatient dermatology clinic in Northern California. Participants provided demographic data and completed a 12-item questionnaire to assess their familiarity, comfort, privacy, and perceptions following routine office visits with an HCP where FMT was used to document the clinical encounter. Data were analyzed using appropriate descriptive and inferential statistics. RESULTS: Over half of the 170 study participants were female (102/170, 59.4%), 60.0% were Caucasian (102/170), 24.1% were Asian (41/170), and 88.8% were college-educated (151/170). Age ranged between 18 and 90 years (mean 50.5, SD 17.4). The majority of participants (118/170, 69.4%) were familiar with FMT, not concerned with privacy issues (132/170, 77.6%), and stated that the use of FMT did not affect their trust in their HCP (139/170, 81.8%). Moreover, participants comfortable with the use of FMT were less likely to be concerned about privacy (P<.001) and participants who trusted their HCP were less likely to be concerned about their HCP using Google Glass (P<.009). Almost one-third of them self-identified as early technology adopters (49/170, 28.8%) and 87% (148/170) preferred their HCP using FMT if it delivered better care. CONCLUSIONS: Our study findings support the patient acceptance of Google Glass use for outpatient dermatology visits. Future research should explore the use of FMT in other areas of health care and strive to include a socioeconomically diverse patient population in study samples.","Sandra Odenheimer,Deepika Goyal,Deepika Goyal,Veena Goel Jones,Veena G Jones,Ruth K.

10.1186/s12873-018-0188-z,30558573,,Strategies for improving physician documentation in the emergency department: a systematic review,"Physician chart documentation can facilitate patient care decisions, reduce treatment errors, and inform health system planning and resource allocation activities. Although accurate and complete patient chart data supports quality and continuity of patient care, physician documentation often varies in terms of timeliness, legibility, clarity and completeness. While many educational and other approaches have been implemented in hospital settings, the extent to which these interventions can improve the quality of documentation in emergency departments (EDs) is unknown. We conducted a systematic review to assess the effectiveness of approaches to improve ED physician documentation. Peer reviewed electronic databases, grey literature sources, and reference lists of included studies were searched to March 2015. Studies were included if they reported on outcomes associated with interventions designed to enhance the quality of physician documentation. Nineteen studies were identified that report on the effectiveness of interventions to improve physician documentation in EDs. Interventions included audit/feedback, dictation, education, facilitation, reminders, templates, and multi-interventions. While ten studies found that audit/feedback, dictation, pharmacist facilitation, reminders, templates, and multi-pronged approaches did improve the quality of physician documentation across multiple outcome measures, the remaining nine studies reported mixed results. Promising approaches to improving physician documentation in emergency department settings include audit/feedback, reminders, templates, and multi-pronged education interventions. Future research should focus on exploring the impact of implementing these interventions in EDs with and without emergency medical record systems (EMRs), and investigating the potential of emerging technologies, including EMR-based machine-learning, to promote improvements in the quality of ED documentation.","Diane L.

10.1016/b978-0-12-809523-2.00004-2,,,Electronic Clinical Documentation,"Abstract   As clinical notes become increasingly and universally electronic, there are a series of key opportunities and challenges facing users and developers of this technology. An emerging series of “chief complaints” are being heard from clinicians using electronic records, both in terms of dissatisfaction with workflow and time entailed in entering their notes, as well as quality and usability issues with the notes being produced. We conceptualize eight goals for redesigned clinical notes. Because clinical notes are so closely tied with developing and documenting diagnostic assessments, we highlight important quality and safety goal and discuss current challenges and opportunities in reengineering documentation to improve diagnosis. We also discuss key emerging issues such as controversies surrounding copy/paste, alternative formats and methods for data entry (including scribes, speech recognition), problem-based charting, and issues related to opening notes up to patients.","Gordon D.

10.1136/heartjnl-2015-308724,27504000,,The electronic health record as a catalyst for quality improvement in patient care.,"Electronic health records (EHRs) are now broadly used, following decades of development and incentive programmes for their use. EHRs have been shown through use of reminders, electronic order sets and other means to improve reliability of performance of many basic tasks in acute, preventive and chronic care. They assist with collecting, summarising and displaying the large volumes of information in patient records and support the implementation of guidelines and care pathways. Broad use of EHRs has brought into focus weaknesses of the current generation of EHRs: their user interface, implementation difficulties, time required to use them and others. Addressing these weaknesses and adopting new technologies, including use of voice, natural language processing and data analytic techniques, is necessary for EHRs to achieve their full potential: to gather information from routine care, to learn from it and to be an integral component of efforts to continuously improve and to transform care.",Thomas H.
